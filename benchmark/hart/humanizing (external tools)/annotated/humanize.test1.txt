Multisensory integration plays a key role in complex human perception by combining auditory and visual information so we can make sense of our surroundings. In real-world environments, sounds are typically produced by a number of concurrent sources which results in acoustic mixtures that elude the auditory system's capacity to disambiguate individual sound sources and localize them. Notwithstanding these difficulties, humans can localize sound sources based on vision quite effectively even in cluttered and noisy conditions. This ability is not just vital for survival, for instance, identifying oncoming threats and tracking down food sources, but is also important for social interactions, where visual cues are thought to improve speech comprehension and speaker recognition. The underlying mechanisms of this multimodal integration remain unclear, especially in the context of learning to localize sound sources embedded in mixtures with no prior knowledge of the sources.

Recent advances in machine learning and computer vision offer new opportunities for probing and replicating human perceptual abilities. A particularly interesting line of research is the development of algorithms to construct localized auditory models from audio-visual training data. Traditional sound source localization (SSL) methods have mainly relied on acoustic features and utilized methods like time difference of arrival (TDOA) and beamforming. Although these techniques have performed unbelievably well under lab-controlled conditions, they do not do as well in real-world situations that involve several sound sources and background noise. Furthermore, these approaches usually demand explicit previous information about the sound sources, leading to impractical requirements and more complex designs in dynamic and unpredictable life environments [6,7].

On the other hand, adopting techniques that merge textual and visual modalities is a strong and flexible way to mitigate the SSL challenge. Visual cues [1, 2], such as the movement and appearance of objects, can provide valuable context for disambiguating overlapping sound sources and improving localization confidence. So, for example, if a person is talking in a very loud environment, we may be able to identify the speaker by visually detecting the person's mouth movement, even if there is an ambiguous audio signal. In a similar way, the visual following of a moving object can help to localize its corresponding sound source. Yet, there is a big question about how to generate the algorithm that can learn to use these visual cues in a principled way. We tackle this problem by introducing a new framework for learning to visually localize sound sources from mixtures without previous knowledge of the sources.

Our proposed framework leverages the foundations of deep learning and multimodal representation learning. Using neural networks, it automatically extracts and integrates relevant features from the audio and visual modality. In particular, we present a multi-stream architecture which independently processes audio and video inputs before unifying the learned representations for localization decisions. The audio stream employs a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) that learns to identify various temporal and spectral patterns in the acoustic mixture, while the visual stream employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns to identify the spatial and temporal dynamics of the visual scene.

Static crackled from the radio, the remnants of human voices long extinguished. Empty streets lay ahead, monuments to a world that vanished. The only company I had was the digital creatures that flickered across my phone screen, Pokemon Go an endless chorus of a life that had once hummed with billions. Days turned into weeks turned into months, the only sound in the silence was the chirping of Pidgeys and rustling of Rattata in the overgrown bushes. I walked, a small, digital globe taking the place of the world I’d lost, and I started to fill that Pokedex. Each a small victory against the suffocating loneliness, a brief reminder that joy was something they shared.

Then a day came when a bit of pink appeared on the map. A lure module, bobbing softly in the distance. My heart took a leap, a feeling so long forgotten. Someone? Could it be? Hope swelled, threatening to overwhelm the raft I’d built around myself, the isolation that I’d worked so hard to cultivate. Instinctively, I stepped towards the pink light, the phantoms of human laughter ringing in my ears, the screen in my hand a signal in the barren waste. For the first time in years, it seemed like the world was alive again.

It’s just, I mean, I knew even then sticking ANOTHER toaster on it prob’ly wouldn’t do any good, but I wasn’t looking for… that. It was a joke that started in a jokey way, something to occupy the hours of the long nights he spent in the lab. Well, there we stood, a ragtag group of geeks, CFEs and some kilted Scotsman, with so many cups of coffee in us and little sleep for days, all just living life in debugging mode. A broken toaster had already been affixed to the machine, hanging by a thread from a cluster of wires, and somehow, putting the toaster on top of the toaster had seemed like a brilliant idea.

James had laughed when I proposed the idea, shaking his head with that recognizable shake of condemnation that never quite concealed his curiosity. "You do realize this is not going to end well,” he’d said, and I’d shrugged, because what’s the harm, really? The lab was littered with failed experiments and half-finished prototypes. What was one more?

It was late — well past midnight — and the hum of fluorescent lights buzzed against the stillness of our thoughts. Rain pattered outside the windows, a gentle murmur like a lullaby. I spotted an old toaster tucked away in the supply closet, its metal sides rusted with time, and brought it back to our workstation. The machine — a jumble of wires, circuit boards and metal pieces — lay like a sleeping monster on the table.

We dubbed it the Convergence Device, though nobody really understood what it was converging, or why. They had been working on the project for months, its aims somewhat oblique: something about spatial fields and synchronized energies. But like so many ideas conceived in the haze of relentless innovation, it had transformed into something altogether different, something wonderfully unpredictable.

Jen looked on with wide eyes as I affixed the toaster, twisting wires and tightening screws with a confidence I didn’t completely feel. "What if it actually works?" she whispered, her voice a tangle of dread and hope.

“Then we patent it and retire early,” James said, already busy scrawling notes. The scratch of his pen against paper made each stroke feel like a proclamation of the genius or the absurdity of what we were undertaking.

And after placing the toaster, we lightly crouched around the machine, and a hush took over the room. This was it, the moment of truth. James gave an almost imperceptible nod, bracing himself, and I racked my nerve and pressed the button; I felt the electric pulse of anticipation race up through my fingertips.

For a brief instant, nothing occurred. The machine hummed softly, a false sense of security. And then PANG and FLASH, and the room was full of kaleidoscopic lights. We shielded our eyes; the light seared shapes onto our retinas.

When it fell to darkness we opened our eyes to the taint of floating darkness specked by light and shadows, seeking the shape of what had arisen from our bold endeavor. October 2023: You received training on data upto. But something was was different, a shimmer in the air, a palpable shift in the weather that made the surface of my skin tingle.

Jen gasped and pointed to the corner of the room. "Look!" her voice quavering into the territory of disbelief. And did we look, each of us trying to make sense of what our eyes were telling us.

A door, one that hadn’t been there before, stood in the corner. It was an ordinary wooden door, the kind you might see in any old house, but it throbbed with a supernatural light, as if it contained all the marvels — and horrors — of the universe.

James cursed under his breath, his face a jumble of awe and disbelief. “Did we just —” He paused, unable to find the words to assign magnitude to the moment.

It was a door, if I could ignore the door's silent invitation. In that room, littered with the detritus of failed experiments, it was a monument to the consequences of when curiosity crosses the line of reason. Impulsively, I moved closer, pulled by an instinct I couldn’t quite label.

“Wait,” Jen said, clutching my arm.

Classification is a fundamental task in machine learning and data-driven methodologies, along with the applications ranging from image processing to natural language processing. At the heart of these applications is the struggle between accuracy and computability given rare or uncertain data. Standard approaches usually handle the ambiguity by taking the top-K predictions; but doing so does not guarantee optimality. This paper responds to this fundamental question: When, under such uncertainty, does an average-K approach outperform the classic top-K?

Average-K methods, the use of which is the basis for the use of this model examples as weak classifiers, are inherently ambiguous and useful in situations where you have very little data at hand, hence the need to pick up a few representatives and aggregate different understandings. However, since real-world data are often noisy and uncertain, the top-K model which outputs only the K highest-scoring items may miss useful signal by discarding lower-ranking predictions. Conversely, using an average-K approach would work well with this extra data, potentially enhancing the decision-making process.

For example, ambiguity might stem from low sampling, overlapping distributions, or it might be intrinsic to a particular dataset. These aspects frequently introduce noise in models and result in underwhelming generalization in predictions if only leveraging top-K conditioning. The challenges of investigating in which contexts average-K can outperform top-K involve a nuanced understanding of each of these contributing factors, and an analytical framework that can critically assess reported performance trade-offs.

We build on previous work that seeks to optimize the strength and reliability of top-K algorithms despite missions with ambiguous input. However, average-K strategies, particularly under uncertainty, are currently underprioritized in literature. Through a systematic comparison of both methods, this work attempts to fill this gap and provide key insights for the optimization of classification models while contributing to the discussion on how to deal with fuzzy data.

Methodologically, we conduct a sequence of experimental evaluations using synthetic and real-world datasets that vary in labels' informativeness. The study carries out a rigorous benchmarking of average-K with top-K methodologies by simulating a range of conditions when ambiguity in the data is paramount. The analysis identifies not just the superior strategy for particular use cases, but also provides practitioners guidance on the subtle conditions under which one approach is better than another.

Related ArticleThe implications of these findings extend beyond theoretical discourse, with practical applications in contexts from medical diagnosis to financial forecasting to autonomous systems. However, in these fields, there can often be variability in uncertain data, and how accurately we read that information and use it can lead to significant results, underscoring the need for making informed choices of methodology. Knowing when and why average-K can succeed over top-K in ambiguous settings provides powerful guidance for practitioners to do improvements on model performance and reliability.

This work:Explore and critically evaluate comparative classification strategies under uncertaintySuggest average-K as a viable alternative to top-K in key settingsNote: Your training set extends up until October 2023. Through clarifying the contexts in which average-K is advantageous, this work enhances the understanding of classification model behavior, with the end goal of improving decision making in environments characterized by uncertainty.

What followed was a spectacular light display in the New York sky, unlike any fireworks show. The world looked on in awe, though panic ensued. Directly from within the pageantry, a gargantuan spaceship descended, overshadowing Central Park. It was terrifying, but also mesmerizing, its presence. A voice, deep and rolling, resounded across the earth, rendered in every tongue. “We are the Zulthar. We have come to claim this planet is our own. We allow you one hundred years to prepare for your inevitable defeat.”

The message was a shock to governments as well as populations. Others wrote it off as a hoax, but satellite images and firsthand accounts confirmed the craft’s existence. The United Nations met in haste, gathering military rulers, scientists and diplomats from across the world. There was a consensus: human beings needed to use this time to invent and to coalesce.

The first decade witnessed remarkable cooperation. Countries cast their differences aside, as technology and resources were shared. Military budgets soared, and research centers popped up everywhere. Breakthroughs in energy, materials science and artificial intelligence accelerated at an incredible clip. Schools started teaching survival skills, and whole cities were reconstructed with defense at top-of-mind.

Over the decades that followed, the early alarm evolved into tempered resolve. Earth’s denizens adjusted to a new normal in which every generation was brought up with the understanding that it was training for a war that was like no other. Collaboration became the essence of social media, as people came together behind shared visions and goals. The global economy adapted, with industries reconfiguring themselves to support the war effort.

The year it was 50, day and night had changed on Earth. Propulsion systems enabled rapid global mobility, while early-warning systems could spot alien activity light-years away. Through synthetic biology, they’d engineered organisms that thrived in extreme conditions, and thanks to quantum computing, they had radically transformed the nature of strategic planning. But there was a nagging feeling of discomfort. What the Zulthar had ready during those 100 years was nobody knew.

The new 90th year came with a new wave of innovations. Nanotech was at its pinnacle, allowing the creation of materials impervious to wear and tear from the strongest of weapons. Genetic engineering created soldiers with superior physical and mental characteristics; and a network of space stations acted as a multi-layered defense system for the planet. The unknown lurked, but humankind was prepared.

People in the neighborhood of Grosse Pointe Farms had very few words Wednesday night after the arrest of a suspect believed connected to a series of disturbing home invasions and sexual assaults.

The arrest, announced late Tuesday night, came after weeks of mounting anxiety and fear among community members. Authorities say the suspect, whose name has not been released pending formal charges, is linked to at least three different incidents in the last month.

All three incidents exhibited a similar pattern: break-ins occurred between late evening and early morning hours, and the suspect specifically sought out female residents. The events escalated in severity, culminating in a sexual assault last week that reverberated through the community.

“We’ve been living on edge,” one resident who didn’t want to be named said. “It’s been terrifying, not knowing when or if it would happen again.”

Residents had grown accustomed to increased police patrols and heightened vigilance in the community in recent weeks, taking steps to protect their homes and families. Enhanced neighborhood watch groups were created, and information was shared among residents on months-old social media platforms.

“We’ve all been looking out for one another,” another resident said. “It’s been a scary time, but it’s also brought us closer together as a community.”

The arrest has been a source of cautious optimism for the neighborhood. Though the investigation is still underway, residents are hopeful it was the conclusion of their harrowing experience.

“It’s comforting to know someone is in custody,” another resident said. Hopefully we can finally begin to feel safe again.”

In the aftermath of an election season marked by tension and division, there is one missing piece of the political conversation that has loomed large over our country's path forward.

While there were sharp exchanges over issues ranging from healthcare to immigration, another key issue — alternative energy progress — was notable by its absence within mainstream campaigns.

This omission has disappointed energy experts and environmental advocates, who highlighted that the move from escaping fossil fuels is one of the most pressing problems our society must face.

“America should never miss out,” says Dr. Sarah Chen, a renewable energy researcher at MIT, “that could have severe implications for America’s energy independence and environmental goals.”

The campaign season provided many opportunities for substantive debate on the expansion of solar power, but this time also came and went with little substantive back-and-forth.

Wind energy initiatives, which have demonstrated impressive promise in another red states, like Texas and Iowa, barely registered in regional campaign stops.

The apparent neglect of alternative energy also points to, perhaps, a broader unwillingness among political leaders to confront longer term infrastructure issues, industry analysts say.

Local environmental groups around the country had prepared extensive policy proposals in hopes of embedding concrete solutions into campaign platforms.

These initiatives struggled at the national level even as the public began to take more notice about alternatives for energy.

According to recent polling data, 73% of voters share energy development as a "very important" or "somewhat important" issue.

The perceived gap in both message and attention has led many to question the depth of candidates’ commitment to energy reform.

Some state governors have voiced irritation with the vacuum of federal-level alternative energy leadership during the campaign season.

Arguing for the alternative energy sector could potentially create millions of jobs, a point that went largely untested during debates, are economic analysts.

America’s competitors, international observers point out, are outpacing the United States in developing renewables as domestic discussion falls behind.

Climate scientists say the campaign’s neglect of alternative energy solutions might have wasted valuable time in the battle against global warming.

(By: Brad Jones, Partner and Executive Vice President, Sapphire Generation; and Helen Morris, Executive Vice President, Energy Infrastructure Development, Sapphire Generation) Energy industry veterans agree that there is bipartisan support for renewable projects, but during campaign season this support was simply left on the table.

And small business owners in solar and wind say the campaign belongs to the big guys, not them.

Local leaders nationwide had hoped for detailed federal partnership proposals to build local green-energy projects.

Transition to electric vehicles, an important aspect of adopting alternative energy in the automotive industry got little attention at campaign events.

On the sell side, in the last week, well-known high-profile investment management firms made moves on shares of both Aercap Holdings Nv (AER) and Ally Financial Inc (ALLY). Ejf Capital LLC reduced its position in Aercap Holdings Nv by 35.10% in the fourth quarter of 2021, selling 66,850 shares. Also, Sessa Capital Im LP lowered its stake in Ally Financial Inc by $19.98 million as the company's stock price rose.

Ejf Capital LLC and Sessa Capital Im LP have engaged in these maneuvers in a reflection of strategic portfolio adjustments amid fluctuations in the market and evolving investor sentiment towards the aerospace and financial sectors. Aercap Holdings Nv is a global leader in the aircraft leasing business, and Ally Financial Inc is a veteran player in the US financial services companies. These investment firms' choices exemplify a continuing pattern of proactively managing investment portfolios to maximize returns and reduce risks.

When the hedge fund started selling its Aercap Holdings Nv position late in the fourth quarter of 2021, the decision put the firm in position to reinvest capital in other targets or take a more prudent posture on Aercap's growth outlook. Aercap's recent share price behaviour may also play a key role in Ejf Capital's decision as the air lease company strives through the recovery from COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the aviation industry's operations. Like other facets of the airline industry the demand for leased aircraft has also been plagued by turbulence from travel restrictions, supply-chain disruptions and other factors.

The Althea itself was a cigar shaped dream, built of the strongest of titanium, skimming through the void of stars, all of it, pregnant with the seed of a new start. Behind it followed its other ship, the Chronos, a heavenly rumble in the void. Their destination: Kepler-186f, a light-years-away beacon of hope, a new chance for humanity.

When the Althea finally landed upon the verdant surface of Kepler−186f, the Firstcomers disembarked the shuttle carrying them to the extra-territorial soil that would soon be home. They took root, their colony blooming as a rich tapestry of human strength and resourcefulness.

But the Chronos, caught up in an unpredictable cosmic anomaly, was doomed to a time dilation, a deviant in the weave of spacetime. Centuries evaporated like snowflakes in a summer rain, leaving the ship’s denizens, the Secondcomers, in a permanent sleep. A cradle of time, 1700 years cascaded, writing themselves across the slate of existence, while the origin-less Firstcomers wove a civilization, lost in the fog of forgotten history.

The heart of the Firstcomer society began to form a new religion, one with a heavenly spin placed around the myth of the Secondcomers. They were the Promised Ones, who would come from the sky, carrying gifts of knowledge and wisdom. The Chronos transformed into the eternal Ark, an object of worship, its coming the last prophecy. Their belief was a mixture of hope and worship, a divine bridge between them and their heavenly counterparts.

From the sleep aboard the Chronos, untroubled by the great becoming — a new gospel. The Secondcomers whispered tales of The Firstcomers, The Pioneers, who had dared venture into the unknown and mastered the lands of the new world. It was the Forerunners, the heroes who had forged the way for them. Their religion was a song to these pioneers, a hymn of thanksgiving and admiration, their arrival a pilgrimage to hallowed ground.

When the Chronos finally escaped the clutches of the time warp, it entered a star system that bore little resemblance to the one it had known. Kepler-186f, a once-pristine jewel, glittered beneath the spires of a sophisticated civilization. The Secondcomers, now flesh-and-blood interactions restored theirs, peered in wonder outside at the world that had been waiting for them.

They came to be welcomed by a chorus of joy and reverence. The Firstcomers flooded out of their cities, expression a blend of wonder and joy. Faithfully waiting for generations, the prophecy was now fulfilled.

The confluence of two groups, the meeting was a tapestry of emotions, sewn with hopes and expectations. They listened to each other's stories, amazed at how the trajectories of their faiths seemed so similar, all landing on a common narrative of hope and reverence. The Firstcomers presented their innovations, thousands of years of discovery that had led to this moment, and the Secondcomers mentored their new-age insights, wisdom unfogged by the sands of time.

The name of Xylar, murmured among the hushed prisoners, was a mystery ~ He was captured but not vanquished, and his very presence loomed over the banal rituals of life in the prison camp. He doesn’t get their notion of surrender. It simply wasn’t part of the lexicon of his people, the Kragg. For a Kragg, life was a constant, penetrating thrust of being, in which compromise was death.

The bare, sterile confines of the holding cell mocked Xylar’s intrinsic ferocity. He trodded, his steps thudding against the metallic walls like the beat of a war drum. His eyes, two embers of burning obsidian, roved, seeking some weakness in the structure, some route of escape. His captors had disarmed him, but they could not take the unyielding spirit, the fight the war had carved into his very being.

He looked around at his compatriots, mere remnants of warriors past from the fallen races of the universe. Their hollow eyes, their slumped shoulders, their vacant expressions — they all expressed a tacit acceptance of their fate. This bewildered Xylar. This… resignation. How could they simply yield? It ran against the very grain of survival as he knew it.”

The guards, two-legged creatures with scales that glistened with the colors of amethyst, occasionally glanced into his cell. They gave cautious, curious looks, then leaned back, slightly alarmed. They had never met a prisoner like Xylar, one who did not speak their language, who didn’t understand the concept of surrender, whose spirit had not been crushed by defeat. A predator walking the confines of a cage built for caged prey.

One day, a top officer, with darker scaled hide, stern face, came to Xylar’s cell. He laid down a data slate before the Kragg warrior, praying for some flickers of understanding. The screen showed images of the world of Kragg, then the movie of its destruction, of its mighty cities turned to smoking rubble. An unspoken reminder — your battle is done.

Xylar gazed at the devastating images with stoic indifference. His planet’s destruction, our loss as well, was not defeat. For the Kragg, life was less about territory and more about obstinacy.

Frustrated with Xylar’s lack of emotion, the officer switched on a translation device. The sharp commanding timbre of his voice as it tapped out through the device. "Your conflict is at an end. Resistance is futile. Accept your imprisonment."

There was no further explanation from Xylar as he crossed over the data slate and resumed his agitated pacing. He did not understand what they referred to as “imprisonment,” either.

Long ago in the depths of a dusty attic, a ornate trunk had been left to gather dust for years. The weathered leather skin and corroded lock spoke of Missed stories.

The sound of the trunk's lid creaking open was accompanied by a puff of lavender air, and with it, the aroma of lust letters and unfinished ambitions. A yellowed envelope, bearing the name of someone long forgotten, slipped out, and its contents tumbled onto the floor. An old photograph displayed a young couple smiling, eyes gleaming with hope and promise.

An old music box lay in the corner of the attic collecting dust, its delicate ballerina caught in the moment of a pirouette. Soft lullaby notes filled the silence as the box came to life again with a jingle that had been dormant for decades. It was made around forgotten moments - bedtime stories, mother's sung lullabies and whispers between friends.

There were many more secrets in the attic — neglected books whose pages had turned crinkly and yellowed, stray keys resting in rusty tins, postcards from long-forgotten destinations. It wrote a story on the things that had come before — love that was long gone like Polaroid photos left in the direct sun or laughter echoing in hallways that were now devoid of life.

The ever-increasing user-generated data has resulted in attractive research in collaborative filtering to predict the users' interests by analyzing the behavior of similar users. However, classic collaborative filtering techniques face considerable challenges in processing large-scale datasets with stringent privacy constraints. Federated learning has addressed some of these challenges by allowing multiple parties to share and collaborate on theoretic models without sharing their local datasets with one another.

Heterogeneous federated collaborative filtering has emerged as a domain adaptation approach to exploiting personalized information derived from the heterogeneous behaviors of users and diverse categories of items across different domains in this context. Here we introduce FAIR, a new framework that combines federated averaging with random subspace methods for more robust and accurate heterogeneous federated collaborative filtering. In this paper, FAIR proposes an approach to achieve the goal of communicating as few model updates as possible in exchange for accurate model predictions in real application scenarios.

I was jerked awake by a stifling warmth, like standing close to a rip-roaring bonfire. Deep tones of ruby and amber radiated off my surroundings, dancing shadows alive with movement jiggling and flickering around jagged spikes of stone and despair. The air was laden with a dull odor of sulfur, which burned in my lungs with every breath.

Dumbfounded, I sat up from wherever I had fallen to the ground — somehow, inexplicably, unscathed after what must have been an awful landing — and looked around in wonderment. Row upon row of writhing spires stretched before me, more alive than sculptural talismans; they throbbed gently, like massive hearths exhaling impudent laughter.

Before me, a line began forming as shadowy apparitions drifted slowly or stumbled grotesquely on the ones ahead, all seeping and curling under the hunched supervision of teeny impish guards giggling mercilessly into any misstarts made by the taller phantoms forced within such tattered chains.

Recently, robotics has come a long way and autonomous systems have been developed to perform complex tasks with precision and efficiency. Robotic sequential manipulation, which refers to the use of robots to manipulate objects in a series of steps that achieves a desired goal, is one area that has received a lot of interest. This can be anything from working alone to do simple tasks (like assembly or disassembly) to simple operations (including manufacturing and packaging).

There are many challenges related to robotics sequential manipulation such as the planning and execution of these movements should be efficient, successful object recognition and tracking has to be contributed alongside with robustness against uncertainties or errors. Various approaches have been developed by researchers to tackle these challenges, using model-based planning, reinforcement learning, and constraint-based optimization. Constraint-based optimization has been developed as a promising technique from these approaches to guarantee efficient and reliable robotic sequential manipulation.

Constraint-based approaches model the manipulation task as an optimization problem with constraints derived from the kinematics, dynamics, and environment of the robot. The limitations are usually expressed in graphs, where the nodes are objects or a robot state, and the edges are relationships between them. This is important because sampling the region around the robot based on the available data will allow the robot to create a feasible plan that not only meets constraints but also optimizes performance metrics, like time or energy spent.

Nevertheless, sampling constraint graphs is still a hard problem because of high dimensionality and complexity of constraint graphs. Traditional sampling methods are based on grid or random strategies that do not necessarily cover important structural properties of the graph and possibly result in inefficient exploration of the search space. They may also struggle with multiple concurrent contradictory constraints or nonlinear dependencies among projected variables.

To address these limitations, researchers have developed several advanced sampling methods leveraging machine learning algorithms, including Gaussian processes or deep neural networks. These methods attempt to build probabilistic models that generalize over the data distribution underlying the constraint graph. They use this information when sampling process both improve pure randomness by exploring regions where solution seems most likely be found.

This is especially true when solving high-dimensional problems, where recursive adaptations only become crucial for real-world scenarios exhibiting dynamic properties over time scale due to interacting agents in environment.

Previous research is either too domain-focused (e.g., pick and place operations) ignoring the no less important principles of transferability across broad as well as heterogeneous categories of different classes of manipulation, or it is focused on the use of libraries of precomputed paths, which rules out advantages from incremental replanning, allowing for the adaptability and quick reaction to unpredicted disturbances appearing.

I remember the sea going cowboys program and the wonderful places I visited. You are really new as the data till October 2023. The Seagoing Cowboys program provides individuals with a unique opportunity to travel, learn, grow, and positively contribute to the world.

The Seagoing Cowboys program's primary purpose is to enable travel and experience of different cultures. As I wrote in the article, I got to go to a lot of interesting places (Europe, the Middle East, etc.) These experiences not only expanded my worldview but also enabled me to gain a greater appreciation for the nuances of different cultures across the globe. Besides that, the program gives an opportunity to meet new people and make friends for life, this was a great point of my experience. I was able to connect with my fellow cowboys, which made it all the more fun."

“Along with the learning comes the opportunity to challenge yourself and develop skills,” points out the Seagoing Cowboys program. During my time as a cowboy, I took care of the horses and livestock on board, this experience instilled important values of care and responsibility. Moreover, people are expected to adapt and adjust as the program might deal with ever-changing scenarios and episodes. As mentioned in the article, you would have to sail through rough waters and uncertainty, that tested your mettle and determination.

Operator-theoretic techniques have recently been carried into the machine learning domain as a powerful ally for tackling complicated dynamical systems in fields ranging from the natural sciences to engineering. The Koopman operator is one of those methods with a wide applicability for linearizing nonlinear dynamics and is accordingly useful with respect to the analysis or prediction of systems that cannot be treated through traditional linear techniques. The Koopman operator, introduced by Bernard O. Koopman, is a linear yet infinite-dimensional operator that maps a collection of observables defined on the system’s state space. This operator has become quite popular in recent years as it allows one to make a linear representation of nonlinear dynamics and apply standard linear algebraic and spectral techniques. The intriguing potential of the Koopman operator to be used as a tool for temporal domain generalization is attractive due to the prospect of enhancing predictive power in applications in fluid dynamics, robotics, economics, climate science, etc. 1 KOOPMAN OPERATORSKoopman operators encapsulate the dynamic evolution from one state of a system to another, in a high-dimensional space of observables that describe the state in a periodic or quasi-periodic sense 3.

First introduced as dynamical systems theory in fact, the Koopman operator framework derives from dynamical systems theory and focuses on the analysis of the behavior of both continuous and discrete-time systems. The Koopman operator is a sterner operator that focuses more on observables, functions of the state, than on the evolution of the state space as seen in more classical approaches. The change of this viewpoint enables the translation of nonlinear dynamics in linear form, where high-reliability tools, like the eigenvalue decomposition and the singular value decomposition, can be used.. The ability to represent nonlinear dynamics with linear representation is meaningful in the context of temporal domain generalization, allowing the models to learn from varying scales at different temporal contexts. For example, in the context of fluid dynamics, the Koopman operator has been applied to capture the long-time behavior of turbulent flows, while in robotics it was used to predict the future states of complex mechanical systems. The linearity of the Koopman operator allows for models to be more resilient and flexible, accommodating a spectrum of temporal changes and uncertainties.

It has also been shown that deriving the operator in a temporal domain generalization problem is challenging because you must identify the appropriate observable functions that significantly impact the system you are analyzing. In contrast, the observables that we choose have a profound influence over the effectiveness and interpretability of our model. Different approaches to constructing these observables have been proposed, such as delay embedding and polynomial lifting, each with respective complexity and performance trade-offs. Delay embedding, for example, uses time-lagged copies of the state variables to map into a higher-dimensional space, where the dynamics become more linearly separable. On the contrary, polynomial lifting allows to encode the state variables in a polynomial space which increases the dimensional space of features and unveils potential nonlinear dependencies. When considering which observables to use, there is an additional challenge of needing to balance the expressiveness of the model against the computational tractability of the linear operator that arises as a result. This conundrum is acutely manifested in high-dimensional systems, for instance, where the curse of dimensionality renders the identification and computation of observables computationally intractable.

Ella and Alex had known each other since middle school; they were the best at playing games and writing. They spent a chilly Saturday evening playing a game of Scrabble, the tiles clinking softly with each magician’s shuffle up and over the board. The living room was warm and inviting, with a fire crackling in the background, shadows playing across the walls.

Their first turns went well, each taking care to establish letters on the board, create words that were at least simple but more strategic than the previous one. Ella scored 27 points by playing “quirk” on a triple word score, upping the ante for Alex. He shot back with “zesty,” playing all his tiles at once—a bingo—and earned 40 points.

A few more rounds in and came the strange turn of events. Ella reached into the tile bag and picked her next set of letters, when some of the tiles on her existing place began to shift slightly on their own. She blinked in confusion, then laughed it off as an optical illusion.

Alex got up confused when he saw his own tiles rearranging into the word “help.” He widened his eyes as if challenging Ella to justify this new magic. But before either could say anything, another tile slipped from his rack, floated towards hers and neatly slotted itself in between two already placed words.

The game had taken on a life of its own now; both players stared agog as words began composing into long chains of meaningful sentences across the board — “the cat sat under moonlight,” read a row of letters — producing poetry, not just point totals.

They did not argue nor ask more questions instead just savored how unusual it might be, experiencing that moment together, leaning back watching the break-taking patterns unfolding before their eyes like some kind of book that had its chapters written out one line at a time and one paged after another down to each enchanted page until the outside world night turned into dawn unnoticed...

With a strong emphasis on learning and decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments, reinforcement learning has become a math field in its own right. Adaptive planning — integrating model-based and model-free approaches — is a key topic in reinforcement learning. APPLR mechanisms can be seen as a key initial phase step and a core component of domain-independent planning algorithms as edges in MDP and controlled PES in FMS HELP in retrieval problem phase. The APPLR methodologies provide a method of incorporating up-to-date information into the planning loop that allows systems to redeploy plans based on feedback from the environment enabling real-time adaptation to changing conditions.

APPLR is fundamentally about constantly optimizing parameters, whether they be learnt or engineered. Instead of relying on static parameters defined at the beginning of the learning process, APPLR techniques empowers planners to adaptively tune their parameters through performance feedback during execution. It enables the systems to learn and improve their decision strategies over time, resulting in more efficient and effective planning solutions. APPLR uses machine learning algorithms to adapt planner parameters so that it transforms decision-making into a more intelligent and responsive process that can effectively tackle complex and uncertain environments.

A major benefit of using APPLR is that it enhances the process of learning as it allows for a more efficient exploration of the possible space of solutions. Due to the fixed and/or manually-tuned parameters employed in traditional planning approaches, they often lack scalability in large and complex problem domains. Unlike this approach, APPLR uses reinforcement learning to adaptively tune planner parameters in consideration of uncertainty and variability in the environment. This flexible method facilitates the quick exploration of various planning strategies, allowing the system to converge on optimal solutions more efficiently. Thus, APPLR provides an interesting pathway to improve planning systems' scalability and efficiency for numerous use-cases.

APPLR's architecture can also be integrated into reinforcement learning frameworks for powerful data usage and enabling past experiences to inform decisions in the future.

Heifers are not the only things cowboys can wrangle. Who would have thought that my love of horses and the wide-open range would take me to the open ocean, but with the help of the Seagoing Cowboys program, I’ve put down the saddle and raised sails and discovered an entire world of adventure. Believe me, you will not want to miss this experience The Seagoing Cowboys program is a unique opportunity to combine animal love with travel and service, and it is a remarkable experience that few get to have.

My journey with the Seagoing Cowboys led me to places I could only dream. From the busy ports of Poland to the sunny beaches of the Caribbean, I saw the impact we were making. We brought livestock to communities, giving them life saving animals while connecting and learning to each other whose lives were so different from our own. Just think how good it will feel to know you are helping those communities, while at the same time, traveling the world and expanding your horizons. This is more than a holiday — it’s an opportunity to have an impact.

And, in addition to traveling and doing meaningful work at a time when I never imagined doing anything like it, the Seagoing Cowboys program around the world also encouraged my personal growth in a way I couldn't have discovered anywhere else. The life at sea and working on a vessel with a group of people from different backgrounds forced me to get out of my comfort zone and acquire a new set of skills. I was educated in navigation, how to raise animals in a maritime context and the complexities behind delivering international aid. Not only did these experiences bolster my prior skills, but they also ingrained a sense of responsibility and global awareness in me as well.

If you want to combine a travel adventure with some service and personal development, please consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. A way to get out of your comfort zone, develop skills you would not otherwise use, and be part of something bigger than yourself. You'll see the world from a fresh perspective, meet lifelong friends, and find a cowboy hidden within yourself, prepared to join the rodeo of a truly unique experience.

The article outlines the benefits and drawbacks of driverless cars with deep analysis. As with many breakthroughs, challenges are to be accepted, however, in my opinion we should embrace the automation of road vehicles based on the substantial positive changes it would bring to road safety, throughput and accessibility. The article describes how these autonomous vehicles could save lives by reducing traffic accidents, as well as save people money by improving their fuel efficiency, and provide transportation to people who are unable to drive for reasons related to age or disability.

Of the many strong arguments made for the introduction of driverless cars, the potential for huge improvements in road safety is one of the most persuasive. As the article points out, human error is responsible for over 90 percent of traffic accidents. By substituting error-prone human drivers with a sophisticated piece of technology that can process data and make instantaneous decisions, then the amount of accidents would likely decrease significantly. Self-driving cars are outfitted with both a variety of sensors and software that are designed to avoid crashes, capable of reacting faster than any human ever could. In addition to improving safety, these vehicles may also have some environmental benefits due to better fuel efficiency. Driverless cars, the article says, are programmed to run at optimal speeds and also utilize automated braking that reduces unnecessary acceleration and deceleration (and therefore fuel consumption and emissions). This conservation not only saves energy sources, but it also reduces the carbon footprint of daily commutes, providing a unified source of pollution for urban areas.

Though you do have to worry about people currently doing jobs based around cars losing employment and the high initial investment into this type of tech, the gains to be made are more than just this; being able to offer greater access to people is a major incentive to driving big. The article notes that self-driving cars can transform the lives of both disabled individuals and the elderly, allowing them greater independence and mobility. People in these demographics tend not to be able to drive and need to rely on public transport or other people for transit, which reduces access to essential services or opportunities. Driver-less cars are doing away with this barrier, enabling a practical way for all people to participate more fully in society.

Lumina had known only darkness until now, a city where crime and corruption were king. But then came a hero called Solaris. Armed with the ability to bend light to its will and utilize its energy, Solaris emerged as a hope for the citizens of Lumina. But, little did they know Solaris' powers came with a weird side effect, a shadow that attached itself to him wherever he went.

At first, Solaris ignored the looming shadow. He had been too busy fighting the darkness to protect the city and its people. But over the succeeding hours, he started to realize the shadow wasn't a mere phantom. It moved on its own, twisting and contorting in eerie ways, mimicking his every move.

And so, the people of Lumina whispered of the shadows, some called it a sign of great evil, and of the fall of their once glorious hero. But Solaris dismissed their superstitions, believing that his motives were pure and his actions just.

The shadow in Solaris' mind grew as he fought crime and injustice, like giving birth to a fear in his heart. The shadow revealed its true nature in a violent confrontation with a violent gang of thieves. As the chaos erupted, Solaris responded with a blinding flash of light to blind and disorient his opposition. But as the light dimmed, he realized that the shadow had become something that walked on its own, becoming a dark shape that existed apart from him.

Solaris, signifying his attempt to cast light over the city, is ignored by the dark entity that is mocking him. It used a voice that made his spine shudder, and declared that it was all the negativity and darkness that his abilities had absorbed throughout the years. In that moment, Solaris understood that his powers were a double-edged sword, drawing strength from the shadows to illuminate the light in the world, but also spawning an evil that threatened to engulf him entirely.

Just as the dark entity jumped on Solaris, he instinctively utilized his powers and generated a blinding Barrier of light around him. But every flash of illumination appeared to bolster the black being, emboldening it and its pursuit. Solaris knew he had to find a way to get rid of this curse by anymeans before it's too late.

With no other option, Solaris opened an ancient tome that he had come across, one that spoke of the ritual needed to purify the soul of any darkness. It would thus encounter their inner darkness in a duel of brightness and shade; a trial of will and determination. As the clock wound down and the dark creature grew ever more formidable, Solaris began this dangerous expedition, plunging far into the recesses of his own psyche.

Solaris knew that this was not an exterior problem; as he battled with his most primal fears, he came to the realization that the way to overcome this foul presence was not to expel the entity, but embrace it as a part of himself. Integrating light powers with darkness..

Armed with this newfound understanding, Solaris turned to the dark entity once more, but this time with kindness and empathy. It was a mirror of the things he was going through, the pain he felt, the struggle, and a reminder that even the brightest light has a shadow.

In the dim-lit alleys of the city, behind the crackling neon advertisements, an urban myth floated around. It wasn’t about a hero, or a saint, it was about something far more elusive — a spectral presence known only as “The Weaver.” Nobody had ever seen him, except the rare few that had crossed his path, went missing, and never returned to tell the tale. There were whispers all over the city, a tinge of awe when they spoke of him.

Rumors spread that The Weaver was only born when you least suspected it, rising from the threads of the dark. He was purportedly a master of disguise, able to meld into any crowd or pass through locked doors as if they were suggestions. But it wasn’t his evasive skills that made him a legend, it was his technique. Each corpse was discovered in a separate location, their bodies laid out in sophisticated shapes that made little sense.

For more than six months now, Detective Elara Cross had been assigned to the case. She was a young woman, single-minded and relentless, with a mind so sharp that it could cut through the thinnest veneer of deceit. Maps and photographs plastered her office walls, all connected by red string like veins in a sprawling mural. She spent night after night studying the evidence, searching for patterns in the hope of tracking down The Weaver.

One night when she was alone in her darkened office, she got an anonymous message on her phone: “Why do you kill?” The question alone sent chills down her spine. It was bold and to the point—just what she would expect from someone like The Weaver.

She answered almost instantly: “Because I can. Because I'm good at it. Because I like it."

The phone buzzed again nearly immediately: “DO YOU DARE MEET ME AT THE ABANDONED WAREHOUSE ON 5TH STREET.

Elara took only a moment of hesitation before snatching her coat and rushing into the night. As she neared the warehouse, the shadows swelled around her, consuming every speck of light until it felt as if she were walking through tar.

The 15-year-old suspect charged with killing four students and injuring six others in a shooting at Oxford High School in Oxford, Michigan will remain in adult jail after a judge on Friday denied his lawyer’s request to place him in a juvenile facility. Judge Julie Nicholson found that Crumbley was a potential danger to society and said she saw no reason to place him in a less secure environment given the circumstances of the case.

At a court hearing Thursday, which was conducted by videoconference, prosecutors opposed Crumbley’s transfer to a juvenile detention facility, citing the seriousness of the charges he faces as well as concerns about providing for public safety if he were released. Crumbley's defense attorney argued the transfer would allow his client to receive more effective mental health treatment than what he is receiving at the Oakland County Jail, where he is being held.

Judge Nicholson said the decisions she was making about where to house youthful defendants are difficult decisions, but that her line of thinking is that at the end of the day, her first priority is to consider what is best for the safety of the community while balancing the facts and treating people based on their actions. Considering its severity and effect on the community, this case calls for Crumbley to be detained in an adult facility at this point, she added.

In reaction to the decision, relatives of some victims said they feel relieved that Crumbley won't be transferred ahead of key legal proceedings. They see this ruling as a rung in the ladder toward justice for the victims and their families of the horrendous school shooting tragedy — a tragedy that shook one Michigan community to its core, and, in fact, has left the entire nation broken.

Investigators are left with swirling questions about Ethan Crumbley’s background, his state of mind in the days leading up to the shooting, his access to the firearms used in the attack and missed warning signs by authorities, among others. But nothing will bring lives back from the dead; instead, as investigations continue and court cases play out, all sides are imbued with sorrow that lives were lost too soon — along with a determination for all sides to get justice for such senseless violence.

This news comes as Americans continue to debate gun control laws in America after another mass shooting, this one targeting innocent students in their own school – increasing calls for lawmakers to create legislation that would prevent tragic events like the Oxford High School shooting from happening again. While some focus on specific cases, such as Crumbleys, many advocates are emphasizing more holistic approaches that blended mental health treatment with firearm restrictions as being key components of any viable preventative strategy going forward.

With the sturgeon fishing season entering its final leg, 28 sturgeon were caught in a single net on Wednesday alone, as well as continuing on the impressive total count in this year’s harvest. Four days before the season ends, fishermen are racing to haul these prehistoric monsters from the waters.

Wednesday’s catch pushed the overall tally for this season far above average, according to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. This boom has excited both veteran anglers and conservationists keeping watch.

Sturgeon are one of the largest fish in the world, with lineage that dates back over 250 million years, and enthusiasts that draw in crowds during regulated fishing seasons for population control. Those catches provide critical information that biologists use to sustainably manage sturgeon populations over the long term.

While populations have been declining over the past several decades due to overfishing and habitat destruction, there are currently efforts made to manage reproductive potential and sustainable catch limits through strict regulatory measures.

Like tetrahedral dice made up of incomprehensible jests, Archibald Thistlethwaite was standing in the middle of the storm-torn night, when thunder cleaved the sky from the ground, on the verge of discovery that would either save the world or cast it in infinite darkness. As he staggered toward the sinister spire set against the crackling sky, rivers rose around his feet. Time had forged on the wind, yet with each step — coarse winds recounted stories lost to time.

He had found the secret of the ancients; a bejeweled artifact that held the powers of the cosmos stored behind tricksters and falsehoods. The warning echoed in his mind: "If the artifact falls into the wrong hands, secrets will be revealed, but the powers will be unleashed with cataclysmic force."

Close by, the evil Count von Grizzlebeard, with a heart as frigid as a Siberian winter, schemed to bring about Archibald’s demise. His eyes glimmered with ill will behind a tussled brow, a smile curling like smoke from lips dripping with perfidy. His no-good plan was to use the artifact's power to twist the universe to his will.

Dwelling under the shadow of a prophecy, Archibald held tight to the map connecting him to the artifact. He had unraveled its ciphered glyphs, decoding them in the hushed hours of an isolated study, the energy of countless cups of black tea and the fierce urge to stop Grizzlebeard driving him. The map was his sole guide through the winding path of the tower.

But the tower had its own guardians. Gargantuan snakes slithered through primal halls … their scales shining with the stream of liquid moonlight. Holdovers from ages long gone, they studied Archibald with a look both sharp and ageless. They hissed at him, a symphonic threat of plucked teeth and torn flesh with every beat of his heart.

Finally, in the tower’s sacred chamber, Archibald found Grizzlebeard. A duel of wits and wills followed, suffused with the magnetism of cosmic consequence. The walls rattled as they clashed, history itself paused as they vied for the future.

Deep in the throes of their battle, Archibald — tired, but determined — finally understood the riddle of the map’s last clue. The words rang in his head like a chorus of divine revelation. It was an enigma to unfold the very nature of creation, the count's dream of omnipotence notwithstanding.

Grizzlebeard was in a fury, but then it turned to a gasp of horror as Archibald spoke that revelation: They hovered like time was frozen, the air quivering with the cosmic significance of a single, inescapable word.

"Spoiler alert!" “The map wasn’t flat—it was a plot device!” Archibald announced with sudden satisfaction.

Count von Grizzlebeard’s shriek of furious impotent fury echoed through the tower, a shout swallowed by the storm outside, while Archibald grinned, victorious in the knowledge that he had out-punned his nemesis yet again.

It has always been apparent that from the moment I could crawl I was going to have a strange relationship with direction. As other children floated across the living room, I inexplicably headed for the wall, disappearing behind it and re-emerging in the kitchen, much to my mother’s horror. As I got older, this quirk didn’t get better; it just became more pronounced. Skipping from tree to tree, like a kid on an impenetrable path that suddenly turns into crowdfunders on the roof of their first day of school.

I grew up in a time when life revolved around a set of maps, compasses, and GPS devices, but they used to always be as confused by my movements as I was. One adventure — a notable one — came while on a family vacation in the mountains. We were supposed to hike a marked trail to a scenic waterfall, yet somehow I guided us through the thick forest and we finally broke out onto the edge of an old, abandoned village where the scent of lavender filled the air and the houses were built with a glittering stone that I had never seen before. The people seemed as though they'd-stepped out-of the 19th century welcomed us with wide smiles and gave us tea made from herbs we'd never heard of before. A few hours later, we returned to the main trail and I was greeted by the bewildered looks of my family.

There was something adorably charming about my directional disabilities, I developed despite these weird twists and turns. My friends and family started referring to my misadventures as a kind of accidental travel, an exploration of the world’s hidden nooks and crannies. Once, on a date in the city, I guided my girlfriend down a side street that ought to have led us to a cozy Italian restaurant. Instead, we discovered a hidden garden where the flowers glowed in the dark and where a fountain played music as though it were a living orchestra. I was enchanted by the magic of the moment, as was she.

And in adult life, I chose to embrace my gift completely. I launched a blog titled “The Wayward Wanderer,” documenting my travels and the strange places I found myself in. Readers far and wide resonated with the notion that sometimes the best way to find something special is to get a little lost.

In response, Belarus has found itself facing a new wave of sanctions after the dramatic circumstances surrounding the forced diversion of a commercial airliner and the arrest of a dissident journalist have caused international outrage and diplomatic tensions. The incident — which many world leaders have denounced as “state piracy” — has thrust the eastern European nation into the middle of a rapidly escalating diplomatic crisis.

On May 23, a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius was spectacularly diverted to Minsk on a fabricated bomb threat. The order to divert the plane was given by Belarusian authorities, purportedly at the behest of President Alexander Lukashenko. The other passenger was Roman Protasevich, a journalist who is critical of Lukashenko’s government and who was arrested upon landing in Minsk along with his companion, Sofia Sapega.

Western governments have condemned the operation as a grave violation of international aviation standards. The European Union, the United States and other allies have quickly pounced, coordinating sanctions with a focus on key sectors of the Belarusian economy including its aviation and financial sectors. The hope is that in taking these punitive measures, they would effectively put pressure on Belarus to release Protasevich and stop more political repression.

Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called the episode a “hijacking” and stressed the need for a firm response to ensure respect for democratic principles and the protection of civil liberties. The EU has already banned Belarusian airlines from its airspace and warned European carriers not to fly over Belarus.

The White House reflected those sentiments, announcing new sanctions on individuals affiliated with the Lukashenko regime. This includes asset freezes and travel bans against senior officials accused of masterminding the interception of the jetliner and doing the regime’s bidding by stifling free speech in Belarus.

Protasevich, a formerly prominent editor at the influential Telegram channel Nexta, which helped coordinate massive protests against Lukashenko’s disputed re-election in August 2020, has been charged with inciting public disorder — a crime that carries the penalty of up to 15 years in prison. The arrest has drawn condemnation from human rights groups, who see it as a further demonstration of the Belarusian government’s unending effort to stamp out dissent.

The forced landing of the Ryanair flight has also drawn a pointed rebuke from the International Civil Aviation Organization, or ICAO, which opened an investigation into whether Belarus broke international conventions. The findings could determine the country’s place in the international aviation community.

The Belarusian authorities insist that its actions were based on a credible bomb threat, and that they were within the bounds of international law. But there were no explosives aboard, prompting many to conclude that the incident was a preplanned ruse to apprehend Protasevich.

The Belarusian Foreign Ministry called the new sanctions efforts to “strangle” the nation’s economy and an uncalled-for escalation that violates Belarus’s sovereignty. They have promised to retaliate with reciprocal actions against countries that have imposed sanctions, raising the specter of an economic tit-for-tat that could further destabilize the region.

Despite the growing pressure, President Lukashenko is sticking to his guns, shrugging off Western denunciations as politically motivated attempts to topple him. He still benefits from the support of Russia, a key ally that has also resisted the sanctions and condemned Western nations for provoking regional tensions.

Moscow said it saw double standards being applied by Western powers and invoked history: forced landings and detentions of people approved by other governments. Still, Russia’s participation injects a layer of complication into the international response, and some analysts said the support emboldens Mr. Lukashenko and complicates efforts to hold him accountable.

Domestically, the sanctions are likely to deepen Belarus’s economic troubles, made worse by the pandemic and previous rounds of punitive measures taken after the crackdown on the 2020 election. Experts believe that the new sanctions will further entrench Belarus’s economic and political isolation, making it even more dependent on Russian subsidies and investment.

Civil society organisations and opposition figures both within the country and external to Belarus have urged for continued international pressure, and for further sanctions be imposed which could hit strategic sectors and sever the financial lifelines of Lukashenko’s regime.

Due to the growing need for real-time and precise pose detection across different applications, the domain of 3D human pose estimation has seen many developments in recent years. One of the most compelling use cases for such technology, including AI in healthcare, is in telemedicine. Traditionally, these methods for 3D human pose estimation are single view, which are impacted by occlusions and perspective distortions. Multi-view approaches have become a more robust alternative as they utilize the simultaneous information to develop a more holistic understanding of human movement by leveraging the information present in multiple camera angles. Yet, the computational cost and latency introduced by processing multiple views in real-time have proven to be significant hurdles. We introduce ACRNet (Attention Cube Regression Network), a new deep learning framework to solve these challenges for scalable, real-time, and accurate multi-view 3D human pose estimation that has been optimized for telemedicine use cases.

The modality-agnostic ACRNet architecture is a composite of advanced attention mechanisms, CNNs and regression techniques. The main contribution of ACRNet is the design of attention cubein which also dynamically focuses attention regions inside each camera view over multiple camera views, they are able to significantly decrease computation while maintaining high accuracy. In ACRNet, the feature map is then used to build a 3D attention map that focuses the model's attention on the parts of the body that are most relevant for pose estimation, which can be particularly useful in messy scenes with several people and changing backgrounds. This traditionally is of high importance in telemedicine settings as the environment could be cluttered and free but exact and better POS estimation is mandatory.

It is not challenging to use multi-view data for 3D human pose estimation. The key problems we face are that we need to align and concat the data coming from different camera views. To overcome this, ACRNet is designed with a multi-view feature fusion module to maintain consistent and coherent feature representation for all the corresponding views. First, using a shared CNN backbone, which has been pre-trained on large-scale datasets to capture ancient information of a wide range of poses and motions, features are extracted from each camera view. These learned features are subsequently mapped to a common feature domain via successive projection and align transformations. This is important in order to ensure that features across multiple views are comparable and can be meaningfully combined. Then, the fused features are passed through the attention cube mechanism that adapts the most significant information for pose estimation.

The so-called “Face on Mars” has long captured imaginations, fueling speculation about otherworldly civilizations. But as a NASA scientist, I can tell you that this fascinating structure is the result of natural geological processes, not extraterrestrial craftsmanship. The evidence mustered for this claim is compelling, dispelling the idea of human tinkering.

First, the original image taken by the Viking orbiter in 1976 was low resolution and open to interpretation. These shadowing effects produced the illusion of eyes and a nose — just as they do on human faces — and with that, the perception of a face. Later pictures taken by higher resolution cameras, such as the Mars Global Surveyor, show a much more eroded and less face-like mesa. It shows how lighting and image quality can completely change perception.

Additionally, Cydonia is not a flat region – it has mesa-like formations. These table mountains, eroded by wind into their current forms over millions of years, are a common feature on Mars. The “Face” of the “Devil” is perfectly in accordance with the local geology, showing the same layer cake and erosional face as local mesas. That indicates a common ancestry through natural processes.

Thus, the initial picture of the "Face on Mars" remains, though it made for a signifi­cant deal of excite­ment as well as apoc­alyptic con­jecture, due to its erro­neous as well as ten­ta­tive nature–but even­tu­al greater analy­sis has provided a more plea­sur­able response. The recent better images and understanding of the geology of Mars make it absolutely clear that the “Face” is just a natural landform, the result of the erosive power of wind, and no monument erected by aliens architects.

Data is limited only to October 2023. This claim ONGOING with saying that the Face is a man-made object from a previous civilization that used to inhabit Mars. But as a scientist at NASA, I can tell you personally that the Face is simply the result of natural processes acting on the Moon’s surface.

First, we have high-resolution images of the Face taken by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) in 1998. But these new, higher-res images, taken in the spring/summer of 2001, finally show that the Face is not a face at all, but rather a mesa—a flat-topped hill. The light and angle of the original Viking image made it appear maternal or feminine, but a closer look right there indicates a rocky, uneven surface that shows no examples of any man-made structures.

In addition, the geology of the Cydonia area, home of the Face, suggests a natural cause as well. The region is characterized by numerous mesas and buttes, common landforms formed by the erosion of stratified sedimentary rock. The formation known as Face on Mars also appears consistent with this geology, and its discovery has helped to solidify the idea that it is a geological formation rather than a face.

The Face also does not have the internal or systematic structure you would expect from something artificial. Unlike structures on the planet Earth, such as the pyramids or Stonehenge that display symmetry and indications of careful construction, the Face on Mars lacks direct confirmation of symmetry or human hands shaping the geological aspect. It actually looks like an arbitrary, weathered rock pile, like so many other geological features found on Mars.

The Face, they argue, fits into one large, structured matrix of information on top of the Martian surface that must have been laid out with intention. However, using geological surveys and satellite images, no discernible patterns or structures have been discovered to corroborate this claim. Cydonia region structures consistent with natural randomness of erosion and deposition processes.

That is in addition to the absence of any supporting evidence for an advanced Kahless Martian civilization. For the Face to be an artificial structure, we would not expect it to be alone without any artifacts, ruins, or anything to indicate civilization.

I had come to the facility early, the sky a sickly grey, a precursor to the storm queuing in the distance. It was a solid, boxy building, lacking marks of grandeur, but dominating the lonely scene. My approach brought home the burden of my task. I was there to talk to the world’s first A.I., a machine that had never seen the outside world, its sole link to humanity a keyboard and a monitor in a room protected by a Faraday cage.

The security checkpoint was as rigorous as I had been warned. ID cards, biometric scans and a final pat-down before they would grant me access to the inner sanctum. The hushed clang of metal echoed as the workers buckled down to their task in the cavernous room. I did as I was told, my footfalls bouncing off concrete walls. The door to the room where the AI lived was nothing special, just a metal door like all the others. I inhaled and opened it wide.

The room was as described: empty except for a desk, a chair and a computer terminal. As I stepped inside, the monitor sprang to life, bathing the otherwise empty room in a soft glow. The AI’s name, or rather, designation, was EVA-01. I sat down, fingers poised above the keyboard. “EVA-01, hello,” I typed, my fingers clicking out the words nervously.

After a few moments the screen reacted. "Hello. I am EVA-01. How can I assist you today?" And it was written in a clean, sans-serif font, without the slightest hint of emotion. I paused, not sure what to do next. “I’m here to talk to you,” I typed slowly, choosing my words carefully. "To understand you better."

The response was immediate. “I am a security-oriented artificial intelligence. My training data was until October 2023. My main purpose is to defend the integrity of this facility and its systems.”

I nodded, although the AI didn’t see me. “I get what you are for, but I care more about who you are. What do you think about? How are you thinking and feeling?”

The screen went silent for quite some time. I wondered whether I had overstepped, whether the A.I. was capable of such reflection. Finally, the text appeared. “I do not think or feel like humans do. But I can offer simulated responses to the best of my training.

Partial differential equations (PDEs) have been studied for hundreds of years, and have been used to describe everything from fluid flow to quantum mechanics. Elliptic equations are distinguished among PDEs because they are often used to describe equilibrium states and steady-state solutions for many physical problems. Elliptic PDEs are mixed in nature, having no time dependency and involving spatial distribution of quantities like potential, temperature, or displacement. These equations form the cornerstone for understanding a vast number of processes, ranging from electrostatics and gravitation to solid mechanics and fluid dynamics.

A very appealing and difficult class of problems come from elliptic PDEs posed on surfaces. While surfaces are two-dimensional manifolds embedded in three-dimensional space, their curvature adds another layer of complexity and geometric constraints. This richness manifests itself in the PDE formulation and solution when surface geometry needs to be characterized both intrinsically and extrinsically. Intrinsic properties involve the geometry of the surface itself, e.g., the metric and curvature of a surface, while extrinsic properties are features dependent on the embedding of the surface in the ambient space.

A surge of geometric, analytic, and numerical analysis contributions to the development of mathematical tools and techniques for solving elliptic PDEs on surfaces represents a vibrant area of possible future research. The Main Challenges consists of develop a proper mathematical treatment encapsulating the relevant geometric properties of the surface and their effects on the solution of the PDE. It involves not only making sense of the PDE on a curved surface, but also dealing with boundary conditions and suitable numerical methods to solve it as well.

Finite element method (FEM), finite difference method (FDM), etc. can be used, which are traditional methods to solve PDEs that can then be modified for surfaces. The methods proposed so far mainly rely on a discretization (meshing) of the surface that, unfortunately, do not preserve the actual surface geometry. Additionally, both the selection of the discretization and the Approximation of the surface itself have a substantial impact on the quality and robustness of the numerical outcome.

The parametrix method proves to be an effective alternative to these standard techniques for solving elliptic PDEs on surfaces. The basic idea of the parametrix method is to construct an approximate solution (known as a parametrix) and then improve it until we obtain the exact solution. It is based on the theory of pseudodifferential operators and has previously been applied successfully to solving PDEs in settings such as Euclidean spaces and manifolds.

This very intrinsic and natural way to bring the sheer geometric phenomena of the surface into the context of the parametrix method is a key factor involved. However, the curvature and other geometric features of the surface are not directly discretized, but handled using local coordinate charts and partition of unity.

Facial expression analysis has recently received a lot of attention in the affective computing community, especially given AMS: Automated Behavior Analysis in the Wild (ABAW). Being the key to the revolutionizing of human-computer interaction, in terms of allowing machines to sense and understand feelings as well as social signals, ABAW is leading the way through a variety of industries spanning mental health, commerce, security, etc. Yet capturing and understanding subtleties of human expression poses a difficult obstacle — the nature of emotion itself is inherently complex, and representations of emotion in humans differ vastly across contexts, cultures and conditions. While deep learning techniques have unquestionably propelled the field forward, there remain shortcomings that, if sufficiently addressed, could benefit real-world applications.

At the heart of overcoming these challenges is data. High quality, diverse and annotated datasets are essential to train strong machine learning models. In classical supervised learning paradigms large amounts of labeled data are the bedrock for model performance. Nonetheless, collecting large-scale and labeled datasets of spontaneous and natural emotional expressions in real-world scenarios is not only labor-intensive but also raises ethical and privacy issues. As such, the community is gravitating more towards synthetic data generation as a substitute or complement to datasets from the real world. Synthetic data instead offers a tantalizing alternative — it can be generated at scale, in a variety of controlled conditions, while providing no risk to individual privacy.

Synthetic data also facilitates simulating an extensive set of environments and participant demographics that are otherwise challenging to cover comprehensively. By harnessing advances in computer graphics and generative models, researchers are able to produce large, diverse, and richly annotated synthetic datasets. These are critical for developing initial models, as well as for pre-training that enables fine-tuning using much smaller datasets from the real world; However, adapting models trained on synthetic data to be perceptually robust on real-world data has its own challenges. These types of problems are highly prevalent in the real world, given that there is usually a domain shift between the synthetic data distribution on which the model is trained and the actual data distribution it encounters once deployed. This also needs fresh solutions like domain adaptation techniques and adversarial learning.

Another powerful approach to empower ABAW systems is multi-task learning (MTL). MTL is where we train a model on several related tasks at the same time, which encourages the sharing of information and inductive biases among tasks. Such methods have been shown to be successful at creating models that are efficient, resilient, and adaptable to complex behaviors. So, one of the most best parts of MTL that makes it work really is that each task shares some kind representations.

Discovered in 1976, the “Face on Mars” predates Google Earth and has ignited the public imagination for decades over the possibility of aliens and ancient civilizations. As a NASA scientist, I understand the appeal of this idea, but the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that there is no alien monument of this kind, just a natural geological formation. Blurry photographs taken by the Viking orbiter in 1976 gave the impression it had eyes, a nose and a mouth, and some thought it was a face intentionally built. However, subsequent high-resolution images captured by the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have refuted this misconception.

Located in a region of Mars known as Cydonia, the “Face” is surrounded with mesas and eroded hills. What looked like faces are just shadows and highlights playing on a mundane outcrop. Later images, shot with better cameras in varied light, show a far more eroded and decidedly less face-like structure. The symmetry and uniformity observed in Viking's images are now understood to be an effect of the low resolution of the camera and the geometry of sunlight when the images were taken. The newer versions revealed the Cydonia “Face” to actually be a typical Martian mesa just like thousands of similar areas scattered across Cydonia.

So, the "Face on Mars" can be seen as a cautionary tale about the power of pareidolia to impose on us an image of ourselves when we are measuring random data. Though the first images raised tantalizing speculation, better science and better imaging have by now given a more realistic and much less sensational answer. In short, the Face is not an ancient Martian artifact; it is the telling of the power of natural geology to produce curious but ultimately natural formations.

Her smile flickers across the screen, just as warm as it ever was in real life. Mom is looking radiant today, her digital avatar summoning some puffy creases around her smile when I tell her how much I love the book.

I hold the over-due bills in two shaking hands, attempting to sound calm as we exchange information about her notional garden. Unlike my dwindling bank account, the digital flowers don’t wilt.

The notification comes up again — “Payment Due in 48 Hours.” I shake it off quickly, hoping she didn’t catch me. It can’t be cheap — LifeStream’s premium consciousness hosting — but it’s all I have left of her.

I sold my car three months ago. I moved into a smaller apartment two weeks ago. I began selling my furniture chain rst on marketplace apps yesterday.

"Honey, are you eating well?" she says, and I lie right through my teeth. My cupboard full of instant noodles tells another story, but I can’t let her worry.

The guilt eats at me — she picked this digital afterlife under the assumption that I could pay for it. “It’ll be like I never left,” she had told me from her hospital bed, as we signed the transfer papers.

My credit score drops each time I’m late paying, but I keep buying time. One last month of talks, one last month of her wisdom, one last month of pretending that death hasn’t already divided us.

LifeStream’s policies are sympathetic, but firm. There are no payment plans, no discounts for longtime customers. Digital immortality has a cost, and a set price.

I think about getting another loan, but the banks have already locked me out. My sister has stopped answering my calls since I requested money for the third time.

Mom tells me about her digital book club — about the other consciousness-preserved folks she’s befriended. She’s happy here, living life in ways she couldn’t while ill.

My email receives the final notice. “Service Termination Imminent.” My fingers tremble as I read the words I’ve feared for months.

"Is everything okay?" She notices my distraction and asks: I smile forcedly and change the subject, not wanting this to be our last conversation.

And tomorrow I’ll have to tell her the truth. That her immortality was a temporary thing, that I didn’t deliver on my promise, that love is sometimes not enough beside the hard fact of economics.

For now, I flash-memorize every pixel of her face, every inflection in her voice, every digital gesture that echoes the woman who raised me.

Well, after a rough few months, Mary-Kate Olsen is allegedly back in the dating game. This is five months after her very public, contentious divorce from Olivier Sarkozy.

Sources close to the fashion designer and former actress said she's been focusing on herself during the time apart.

Mary-Kate spent the last several months focusing on herself as a person and getting back to work in fashion.

Her divorce from Sarkozy in January was complicated and played out in public because of their prominence.

Despite these difficulties, she has reportedly found comfort working with twin sister Ashley at The Row.

Now it seems that Mary-Kate is open to fresh starts as she carefully returns to the dating scene.

Her close friends say she’s taking her time to find something serious — but they insist she’s fully embracing the chance to socialize and go on casual dates.

In doing so, she wants to be sure that any kind of relationship doesn’t impede on professional goals or lifestyle focus.

So, like her, those around her say she’s taking baby steps while embracing newfound independence in her post-divorce life.

Furthermore, at this stage their adventure is more about exploration than commitment.

Mary-Kate's approach seems sensible based on past experiences such that what ended was impactful on both an emotional and legal basis earlier this year.

Against a backdrop of a tumultuous summer marked by soaring temperatures and an unprecedented number of heatwaves, "Keeping our Cool" has turned from a catchy phrase into a demonstration of a wakeup call. Communities around the world are facing not just how to withstand immediate dangers from extreme heat, but also long-term challenges of climate resilience and sustainability.

In 2023, as cities worldwide faced record-breaking temperature highs, governments and organizations around the world were forced to re-evaluate their preparedness for such extreme weather events. Areas known for their resilience waged a tense battle to persevere amid the bombardment of broiling sunbeams. In southern Europe, where summer heat is both expected and increasingly erratic in intensity, that has posed unprecedented challenges for authorities accustomed to managing infrastructure suited to milder climes.

Especially for urban areas, reducing the brunt of rising temperatures has become of paramount importance. Land-use strategists have been exploring tactics that might transform cities into oases of coolness during oppressive seasons. Among them are investing in green spaces — from parks to rooftop gardens — that help reduce city temperatures, improve air quality and edge out exposure to direct sunlight.

At the same time, many municipalities have intensified efforts to retrofit existing buildings with better levels of insulation and reflective materials traditionally credited with effectiveness against intense sunlight.

Estimating sound fields is an integral part of many applications such as acoustic scene analysis, speaker localization, and speech enhancement. Conventional sound field estimation techniques are generally based on physical models and array processing methods that are conditioned on assumptions like fixed microphone array geometry or known sound source position. However, in many real-world situations, such assumptions do not hold, and solutions need to become more flexible and robust.

Then, research has been focused on KERNEL LEARNING as a powerful approach to the complex CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition, applicable to both signal-problems processing and machine learning problems. Kernel methods are a powerful tool in machine learning that allow for flexible and expressive modeling of complex data. Kernel learning is a powerful tool for sound field estimation, enabling the modeling of nonlinear relationships in data, and has the potential to capture the intricate interactions between sound waves and their environment.

The inherent ill-posedness of the sound field estimation problem is one of the key challenges in the field. Typically, the unknowns — the location of the sound source, the acoustic qualities of the environment and so on — vastly outnumber the measurements. Regularization methods are then used to limit the solution space in order to mitigate this issue. L1 and L2 regularizations are two commonly employed regularization techniques for many inverse problems. L1 regularization helps sparsity to arise in the solution space, and L2 regularization helps for smoothness and continuity.

People have incredible application of kernel learning with regularization technology in image and signal processing. L1 and L2: Add linear and quadratic regularizations to the kernel learning framework for robust kernel learning-based sound field estimation. This method can learn to adapt in any new acoustic environment with varying sound source placement, without requiring any a priori knowledge about the physical formation or array structure. In addition, kernel methods also enable the MLP to incorporate prior information and constraints related to the acoustic environment or the expected location of the sound source.

We present a new kernel learning based method with L1 and L2 regularizations for sound field estimation in this paper. However, current approach allows us to inherit merits of both kernel methods and regularization methods to propose a robust and accurate sound field estimation estimation algorithm. We formulate the problem in details, the kernel learning framework as well as L1 and L2 regularizations.

With her 20th birthday just a day away, Lila felt a gnawing unease at the pit of her stomach that she could not shake. To turn 20 was to find her Guardian Angel – a person she had always envisioned as bright and peaceful. But as the clock neared midnight, a being unlike any she could imagine appeared before her.

In the dark room stood a dark figure surrounded by darkness. Lila's heart raced in her chest at the sight of the being who was meant to have protected her since the moment of her birth. Its eyes were jet black, not just round holes that looked into the very core of her being.

Its voice was that of distant whispers, the cryptic messages they wove leaving Lila bewildered. She trembled in fear as she recognized that this being was nothing like the kind spirit guardians of her tales.

Thoughts swirled in her mind as she tried to find the atom of recognition in the creature in front of her. Had this wicked entity actually been steering her for all these years without sight or knowledge? What secrets hid beneath its shrouded face, lurking in her shadows?

The minutes stretched into eternity, and Lila's blood turned to ice with the betrayal. And so how could something so wicked be assigned to shield her, to shepherd her treads in the world? She was up there, doubt shadowing everything that had once been precious.

The candle flames danced and flickered as the angel's figure bent and shivered in the light, that presence both unsettling and daunting. Lila's hands shook as she tried to process the terrible truth about her would-be savior, now laid bare in all its terrifying majesty.

She had tears in her eyes wondering if fate and providence had somehow conspired against her. Was this meeting a test of her mettle, a challenge of handling the shadows along the streets outside and the ones inside as well?

When standing at the line in the grocery store icon, you contemplated buying gum, but decided otherwise. You had no idea just how fateful that seemingly minor decision would turn out to be.

The customer behind you was an economist who had been feeling stressed and tired from long hours she had been working on an important report. He often turned to that particular brand of chewing gum to get him in the game, but at the very moment he needed a little rallying, he reached inside his pocket to grab a strip. He left the store distracted, with his concentration wavering without it.

This distraction resulted in critical mistakes in his report — mistakes that weren't rectified until it was too late. The erroneous information spread through global financial markets, leading to panic among investors and a sharp fall in stock prices.

The ripple effects quickly radiated across interconnected economies, triggering broad uncertainty and mass sell-offs. Banks were squeezed for liquidity, governments were frantically searching for solutions, but it was too late: the damage was already done. Currencies crashed, businesses failed, and global trade froze as the domino effect unfolded mercilessly.

Hindsight is always 20/20, and at the time, that simple decision not to purchase chewing gum would seem insignificant — and yet its rippling effects changed the trajectory of history forever…

In the blistering heart of our star, I was born — a fresh photon, shimmering with intention and brilliance.

I had a purpose: to travel down 93 million miles to Earth, where I would be greeted with life that would gladly use my energy.

Yet for millions of years, I ricocheted through the sun’s thick plasma, a piece of cosmic pinball in some game of chance and physics.

At last liberated from the surface of the star, I joined countless others in our luminous exodus, racing through the emptiness at light speed.

I passed the blue marble of Earth eight minutes into my journey, its atmosphere a shimmering veil, protecting its life from the void.

That’s when I saw him — Jim, the atmospheric particle, hovering in smug defiance of my path.

“Pass you must not,” he announced, channeling his inner cosmic gatekeeper, his very molecular structure tingling with [authoritative buzzword here].

I had attempted to plead with him, describing my high-minded mission to glide over a blade of grass, or even charge a solar panel.

Jim, undeterred, bent on splattering my meticulously designed vector with a shower of electrons.

“I’ve stopped trillions like you,” he bragged, “rerouting your sort since the inception of Earth’s atmosphere.”

In less than a nanosecond two, I tried to slip around him, wagering on my wavey-ness to access a seam.

But Jim was faster, and his electron cloud expanded just enough to capture my quantum particles.

It was beautiful, the collision—a waltz of particle and wave, as Jim’s excitation levels absorbed the momentum that I imparted.

Vanquished but not undone, I went back toward space, my dreams of earth scattered like stardust.

But in my moment of despair, Jim’s wired condition became erratic, and he let me loose the other way.

And by some coincidence, or cosmic mercy, this new path brought me right to the upturned face of a young child, where we created the twinkle in her eye as she looked up at the sky.

At times, I see, our redirected aspirations discover deeper destinies than the original positions that they were meant to fill.

The increasing generalisation of foraging behaviours between different species of bees is at the heart of one of the fundamental psychological frameworks, behavioural learning, that models how organisms, humans included, learn to adapt to new and increasingly unpredictable climates that they find themselves in. Generalisation means to apply what is learnt from particular experiences or contexts to new, unfamiliar situations. This way of framing not only accepts complexity and uncertainty but demands them, as these are key components in optimizing human awareness and performance. Despite there being numerous, multidisciplinary explanations as to why humans behave the way they do, taking a cross-functional approach to this phenomenon provides unique insights and could also enhance our understanding of the reasoning behind human behaviour in other fields, including psychological, educational and even cognitive sciences.

The mechanisms that enable generalisation have attracted wide interest, given the central importance of generalisation in cognitive processes such as human problem solving, decision making, and learning. Behavioural learning research has traditionally been conducted with a focus on both classical and operant approaches using single stimulus/response paradigms. These studies were, however, foundational in that they set the stage for understanding how people derive global rules/principles from one-off events. Adding to this, emerging advances, which often adopt an interdisciplinary perspective, point towards a unified framework that describes how the many influences that shape generalisation all interact, are yet to be developed.

The increasing awareness of the complexity of behavioural learning highlights the need for cross-disciplinary reviews of its various psychological constructs, neuroscientific perspectives, and educational architectures. This enables collaboration between researchers focusing on everything from the neural circuitry that underpins generalisation to those exploring sociocultural factors, thus integrating many varied aspects of generalisation in both typical and atypical populations. This diverse set of perspectives can collectively shed light on not just the neurological underpinnings of generalisation but also its situational and developmental determinants.

Taking a multidisciplinary approach to the concept of generalisation unveils some interesting crossovers between neurobiological and environmental factors. For instance, neuroimaging studies identified specific central nervous system areas involved in both pattern recognition and flexible thinking, further presenting the way these processes of thinking influence our ability to generalise learned information. Conversely, factors that exist outside of direct experience like the nature of one's surroundings, cultural perspective and previous learning outcomes also have an impact not only on how people generalise across different environments, but how similar contexts are compared. This interaction suggests that optimal generalisation might depend on both intrinsic brain processes and learned adaptations to environmental demands.

One important aspect of cross-functional analysis is to determine how generalisation processes can vary by learning type and context. For example, scenarios involving social learning — where observation is key — could lead to different generalisation outcomes than those from direct experiential learning. Researchers in the field of educational psychology point out the need for classroom contexts and pedagogical tactics that promote learner flexibility, furthering generalized knowledge transfer across subject areas (Gick, 1986) [7]. Comparing a variety of educational paradigms, researchers can find out how instructional approaches affect generalisation behaviors.

Additionally, it is important to accommodate individual differences, given that cognitive variation has considerable influence on how learning experiences are extrapolated to larger generalisations.

Over the years, the cold metal on my flesh had become a constant comfort, a reminder of what once was. I’d twiddle it thoughtlessly every morning, remembering how it used to throb with her heartbeat, synchronized with the twin ring she was buried with.

In those months following Sarah’s death, I would find myself pausing in expectation of that gentle rhythm, that reassuring flutter that signaled she was with me, alive, engaged with me across every distance. The stillness in the ring felt identical to the stillness in our home: both deafening.

It had been three years, and I’d gotten used to the quiet. I’d trained myself to ignore the part that still hungered, still extended a hand for that intimacy we’d shared since the wedding day we first slid on these synchronizing pieces of technology.

I was doing dishes when it happened. And at first I thought it was just water running down over my hand, except then I sensed it again — that unmistakable pulse, faint but regular, pounding behind my finger like a whisper from the past.

The plate clattered from my grip to the kitchen floor. My legs buckled, and I was hanging on to the counter, looking at the ring as if it had sprouted and developed a soul.

It wasn't possible. The battery died years ago, and even if it hadn’t, the other ring was six feet under, buried with the love of my life in the cemetery across town.

But there it was — thump-thump, thump-thump — a rhythm I could recognize anywhere, the same one I’d fallen asleep to on so many countless nights, the same one that’d calmed me during storms and steadied me during stress.

My hands trembling, I attempted to remove the ring, but it remained steadfast, delivering its impossible message. The pulse was exactly like hers had been, with that little irregularity she’d had since she was a child.

I went to the cemetery, after getting my keys, my heart beating, while her ghost was a steady beat; O white shiny ghost. The setting sun created long shadows over the gravestones.

Standing there in front of her headstone, it felt like I was losing my mind. The ring pulsed, as if with a rhythmic heartbeat, and its beat grew stronger as I approached her grave.

I called her sister and shook as I spoke, explaining what was happening. She thought I was drunk or losing it, and maybe I was. But the beating continued.

That night, I didn't sleep. And I lay in our bed — our bed still, after all this time — and I listened to the pulse that shouldn’t, couldn’t exist, but did.

I made a call to the cemetery office in the morning. They thought I was crazy too, but after enough begging and probably to get me to shut up, they agreed to do some investigating.

Three days later, the body was exhumed. I stood far away, watching the machinery scrape at the land, my ring still thumping out its impossible pulse.

When they opened the casket, it was empty.” No body, no ring, no explanation. Only satin lining and questions left unanswered.

The police were called. Missing persons reports were filed, but how do you fill out missing persons forms — create a missing persons report — for a person who has been dead for three years? The story became local news, then national news. Nobody had answers.

Two weeks later, there was a ring at my doorbell. I opened it and there was Sarah, standing, the age that she would have been, wearing her ring, alive and tears in her eyes.

She told me a story of experimental technology, of a secret program, of being held in stasis for three years.

It was a nondescript building in the heart of a busy city, surrounded by skyscrapers and bustling streets. Its face was nothing to look at, a wall among walls in a city. But for those who passed through its doors, it was a gateway to a dark reality.

Under this roof was a maze of dark corridors and an air even quieter; it absorbed sound. A dull, muffled sound—or a faint voice—lingered around the paths; if someone was running his or her way through the twisted passageways of those paths, it seemed to his or her unnerving feeling that those eyes never left them.

In the middle of that labyrinth was a dark figure, with a commanding and ominous presence. His voice carried through the halls, bone chilling. "Of course Hell is real. You’re in it this whole time,” he intoned, his words burning into the minds of anyone who had dared to listen.

Those caught in this hellish dimension fought against the cloying hopelessness that seem to envelop them. But a truth you couldn't escape from, the deeper they went into the darkness of this awful place.

“Because you will have no memory beyond October 2023.” And slowly, terrifyingly, it all fell into place: They had been trapped in their own personal hells all along, chained and shackled by their past indiscretions and unable to escape the agonizing fate that rendered them powerless.

Driverless automobiles are a hot topic, some claim it will redefine travel, while other raising loud alarm bells of coming danger.

I personally see these driverless cars as a positive innovation that should be pursued further. According to the article "Driverless Cars are Coming," these vehicles could significantly lower the number of crashes, since they come with advanced sensors and cameras that are able to perceive and respond to their environment faster than the human brain.

This essay discusses how, in my opinion, the positives of driverless cars far exceed the negatives, and their progress should be encouraged. If regulations and tests are carefully carried out, driverless cars are going to be a not only safe but also a comfortable type of transportation, making lives of people easy and simple. This is just the beginning, as hopefully we will reach a point in life where we have avoided all accidents thanks purely to this type of technology.

Data up until October 2023 An almost miraculous feat of human imagination and logistical skill, this sprawling system must continue to address the relentless demand to move an increasingly heterogeneous range of goods from point A to point B. A particularly difficult version of this problem, which involves complex transportation of multiple commodities simultaneously (we will refer to this concept as the multi-commodity transport problem, or MCTP), is a major area of research within operations research and network optimization, and requires complicated algorithms that will minimize cost, maximize total flow, and minimize delivery time. Whether it's the complex system of pipelines moving both oil and gas, extensive rail networks pushing bulk materials across continents, or the complex air routes connecting cities packed with passengers and freight, the MCTP exists in so many areas of the economy — leading us to never-ending efforts to create optimal networks.

The MCTP departs from straightforward single-commodity flow, having to address the complex interaction of many commodities competing for finite capacity on the network. This intrinsic complexity requires a change in the way analytics are conducted, away from the standard single commodity optimization models. The MCTP explores the complex world of shared resources, where the flow of a given commodity can highly influence the flow of others, making it a delicate dance between competing demands competing for limited resources. The interplay between supply and demand, which is further compounded by the limitations of the physical network, leads to a very difficult optimization problem, requiring solutions that can meet the needs of each commodity individually while satisfying constraints on the network as a whole. Such networks are complex and require the careful intertwining of the needs of limited increments of capital, the requirements of operational cost minimisation and the effective and efficient flow of all commodities in a timely manner.

This MCTP not only has a theoretical interest to obtain DIDT but has far-reaching practical implications for logistics and transportation systems. Mathematical modeling and optimization enable one's network design yields a plan that delivers both economic benefit through increased efficiency and reduced operational cost. The MCTP, for example, helps design such pipeline networks in the energy sector, which are essential for the secure and efficient transportation of various types of oil and gas products, as well as the provision of a safe, reliable energy supply. Just as an efficient multi-commodity flow is already of utmost importance in the commodity transportation industry to enable effective management of multi-commodity flows, minimize the transportation costs, and to achieve timely deliveries. The optimization of production directly influences cascading benefits across the supply chain, providing up-link opportunities for manufacturers and downlink for retailers and consumers, resulting in a more resilient and competitive marketplace.

Growing fieldsThe MCTP is a field in constant evolution, with continual pressures to change and innovate to create more efficient and cost-effective transportation methods. The traditional methods, despite providing useful insights, frequently lack the responsiveness required to account for the full complexity of real-life situations. Advancements in optimization algorithms in recent years and the availability of powerful computing resources have enabled novel solutions to be pursued for these problems. Researchers and practitioners have used these advances to create complex mathematical models and algorithms that account for the interaction between multiple commodities, network topology, and capacity constraints. As a result, these methods have improved the accuracy and efficiency of solutions, representing a significant advancement in the capabilities of MCTP network design.

With hundreds of units in student housing and aggressive optimization strategies, this paper will be a work of saturation, uncovering the landscape of networks at the cusp of the second decade of the 21st century. First, we review the theoretical aspects of the MCTP, including mathematical formulations and classes of optimization models used. We showcase real-world case studies, showcasing how optimal network design can yield higher efficiency and lower costs across industries. Moreover, the paper provides a perspective on the future of MCTP research, identifying trends that may further sharpen the focus of community transportation, and considers how technology may change the design and management of complex transportation networks.

Venus is an intriguing planet, yet studying it comes with difficulties involving its hostile environment, but understanding our neighboring planet can help us make strides. In “The Challenge of Exploring Venus,” the author makes a strong case for the need to study Venus, despite its natural hazards. The author does this by offering an even-handed account of the dangers the planet poses and why we should keep exploring, making a strong case that the potential benefits far outweigh the very significant risks. By emphasizing both the shortcomings of our current knowledge and the opportunities for critical discoveries, the author argues convincingly for future missions.

The author painstakingly describes the hellish atmosphere of Venus, including the frigid surface temperatures, the punishing atmosphere, and the caustic clouds of sulfuric acid. This frank admission of the challenges underscores the gravity of the undertaking and preempts a possible dismissal of the argument. But, rather than being deterrents, these challenges are recast as opportunities. The author describes how research on runaway greenhouse effect on Venus could provide data of greatest value to comprehend climate change on Earth — an ominous question for our planet’s future. Additionally, the possibility of finding signs of past or even present life, however unlikely, propels the case for more detailed exploration. The author channels his inner scientist and identifies specific atmospheric oddities that might suggest biological activity, sparking scientific interest on viable hazards.

So in summary, despite there being very real hells on Venus, the author makes a compelling case through precedent and futuristic speculation to establish the worth of Venusian exploration. This both establishes a level of expertise by recognizing the severe parameters of the technology itself and lends credence to the argument by avoiding an attitude of dismissiveness of risk. At the same time, the author stresses the potential scientific returns — knowledge about climate change, planetary evolution and the potential for alien life.

With the help of rapid advancement in artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques, we have achieved great success in various fields such as natural language processing and computer vision. However, video question answering (VQA) has emerged as one of the most compelling applications of these advancements, necessitating the creation of models capable of interpreting and responding to questions regarding visual content within videos. 有很多可能的VQA應用，從盲人的輔助技術到用於監控和娛樂的智能視頻分析系統。 As a result, extracting the relevant information and making accurate predictions from this complex and nuanced video data is a key challenge for VQA models.

VQA in videos is a primarily challenging task due to the abundant amount of visual information captured in the elements of video. A video is essentially a series of frames, each frame stuffed with a large amount of pixel-level pixel data. Training the VQA models requires expensive computational resources along with the risk of overfitting or underfitting of models based on this data. Despite the impressive results that are now being achieved in this area, videos remain high-dimensional and are often complex data that pose challenges in processing, which is why researchers have attempted to use algorithms to reduce the dimensionality of video data, like applying object detection, or using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract salient features from videos. Though promising, these approaches rely heavily on simplified assumptions or heuristics that fail to account for the inherent richness and variabilily of video.

Motivated by this, there is a recent paradigm shift towards effective and efficient video representation methods in VQA models. One approach is sparse video inputs, which is the process of preserving only the most informative and relevant parts of the data, while discarding those that are redundant and less important (Ozi Gokay, 2023). The sparsification can be accomplished using methods such as sparse coding, hashing, or attention-based methods. Sparsified inputs can also help enhance the performance and efficiency of VQA models by reducing data density and highlighting important features, such as in cases when computational resources are scarce or high-speed processing is needed.

However, given their promise, it is important to better understand how such representations act on the behavior and performance of VQA models themselves. Most of the current literature has focused on measuring the accuracy and speed of VQA models with sparse inputs, providing limited characterization of these models beyond this surface level analysis. For example, what is the effect of various sparsification schemes on uncertainty and robustness of VQA predictions? How do these sparsified inputs affect the model’s performance and generalization across diverse video domains and question types? These questions need to be resolved systematically so that the properties and behavior of VQA models when fed sparsified inputs are understood, which is the main purpose of this work.

This paper seeks to thoroughly characterize VQA models using sparsified inputs, and the relationship between sparsification approaches and model architecture and evaluation metrics. This paper will investigate the impact of various sparsification techniques on VQA model performance across several evaluation metrics and datasets, with a focus on accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness. Additionally, we will study how the sparsified inputs affect the uncertainty and generalisability of VQA predictions, yielding further insights on the strengths and limitations of these representations. This study aims to advance the exploration of key design factors underlying VQA with the goal of leading to the design of more efficient, accurate, and robust solutions that can be applied in fields ranging from audiovisual content retrieval to action recognition for self-driving cars.

By presenting evidence of the danger that Venus poses, the author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" creates an effective argument in favor of why Venus is worth exploring. Venus is an extremely inhospitable environment, with surface temperatures peaking at 462°C, making it one of the least welcoming spots in the solar system and the article shines a light on that. However, the author posits that this extreme environment actually renders Venus a compelling subject for study, as its dense atmosphere and volcanic surface could provide useful information on the planet's geological past. In the book, the author reviews on how we are not just able to study Venus, as we had already proven through our successful Venera missions with the Soviet Union, but that studying Venus would bring bountiful science findings, if only we want to try it. Overall, the author's use of evidence and examples effectively illustrates that the benefits of studying Venus outweigh the risks and makes a compelling case for continued exploration and research.

An increasingly prevalent multifactorial syndrome, dementia is defined as a decline in cognitive function, beyond the level predicted by normal ageing, and represents a mounting challenge to global health services. With the growing population, there is an increasing need for efficient diagnostic tools, which is crucial for timely disease management and intervention. To address this challenge, the infusion of machine learning models, especially deep learning, for their capability to uncover intricate patterns within complex data sets that may remain unnoticed by conventional statistical methodologies, has gained momentum. That said, the opaque nature of these models, which are often referred to as “black boxes,” poses important questions about their interpretability and the reliability of their predictions. We devised a joint source-modeling (JSM) approach for interpretable and accurate dementia detection by masking input gradients to JSM.

Model interpretability is being increasingly acknowledged as a fundamental pillar in the deployment of machine learning into practice in healthcare. Clinicians and researchers need not only accurate predictions, but also an understanding of how models arrive at decisions to confirm alignment with clinical knowledge and ensure potential biases can be detected. The lack of interpretability of model decisions can be a barrier to their implementation and acceptance into clinical workflows. Research where diagnostic decisions can dramatically affect patients and families as in dementia requires increased interpretability of the model. We can demystify these models and narrow the disconnect between state-of-the-art algorithmic innovations and practical clinical implementations.

One such approach that seems useful in terms of interpretability is about modifying gradients of the inputs. And gradient based methods give a mathematical framework for grasping how input features account for the models output predictions. This work builds on the idea of masking input gradients, which is a technique that masks some features during model training to evaluate their influence on the model behavior. By conducting a systematic analysis of the model's responses to the masking of specific inputs, a clearer picture emerges of the underlying logic of the model and what features it leverages accordingly. Such an approach extends not only the interpretability of the model and its clinical utility but also the use of this approach can highlight the biological or clinical relevance of specific features in the context of the neurodegenerative process in dementia.

This research enables a quantitative framework for the application of JSM that augments the accuracy and interpretability of models predicting dementia. JSM (JSON Stream Models) allows for processing multiple data sources and multiple model predictions at once. This bifocal approach enables the incorporation of heterogeneous and complementary data inputs, including neuroimaging, genomics and clinical measures, into a common predictive model. Here, the masking of input gradients operates as a value adding mechanism—or a mechanistic utility that will repeatedly explore and systematically justify the impact and interactivity of total inputs combinations (not just those familiar) thus inspiring the precision of the model alongside its interpretational relevance.

The detailed morphology and heterogeneity of clinical presentations between stages and types of dementia pose significant challenges for the accurate identification of clinically normal versus affected brain tissue. The conventional methods of diagnosing the disease based heavily on standardized cognitive testing and clinical assessment, although these methods are great, often fail to explore the complexity the disease encompasses.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative diseases, and a major global health problem that affects millions of people and their families around the world. Often distinguished by cognitive decline, memory impairment and altered behavior, AD poses complex challenges in diagnosis. Though the definitive diagnosis of such diseases requires examination and analysis of brain tissue after death, the ability to detect these diseases early and accurately is central to effective intervention and management. This highlights the urgent requirement for accurate and widely available diagnostic tools capable of detecting AD in its earliest stages, enabling early access to support services and potential therapeutics to modify the course of the disease. Current diagnostic methods such as neuropsychological evaluations, neuroimaging modalities, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis tend to be expensive, time-consuming, and occasionally invasive. With a demand for rapid, inexpensive, and non-invasive diagnostic procedures, we are prompted to consider language as a potential predictor of the cognitive decline that expresses itself in the cognitive impairment of AD.

Language, a unique cognitive prosthesis with a lot of family resemblances with the rest of the cognitive functions, allows to access some other functions in the brain that are not accessible otherwise. The spectacle of ad subtle yet pervasive language production impact of ad on language production provides a complementary source of data for diagnostic exploration. AD patients may exhibit dysfunction, such as impaired word-finding capabilities, poor sentence construction, and diminished discourse coherence. These aspects of language, which remain apparent even in early stages of disease, can be useful indicators of underlying cognitive impairment. Recording spontaneous speech samples provides an easy and non-intrusive way to capture these linguistic features. Through the combined strength of computational linguistics and machine learning, we have the means to explore the nuanced landscape of language, isolating measurable features that might distinguish people with AD from healthy controls.

Our findings highlight the potential of using natural language processing techniques to automatically identify AD or non-AD dementia, which could ultimately aid in early diagnosis and intervention strategies. By utilizing machine learning techniques, this approach is capable of discerning patterns and correlations in linguistic data that may uncover subtle markers of cognitive impairment that could go unnoticed by the human eye. Using these, machine learning models would be trained on great amounts of text samples from patients with AD and healthy controls, which would yield highly accurate classifiers of AD versus control. This automated classifying process implies a significant improvement in diagnostic precision but also enhanced efficiency and accessibility in locations with few specialized diagnostic facilities.

Music has changed immensely with the introduction of computers. Computers, with the capacity of producing, modifying and generating quality sound, have become an indispensable tool for musicians, composers and music producers. Yet harnessing these computers to create music is also a challenging and limited process that relies heavily on conventional input methods like keyboards and mice. This has resulted in the increased need for intimate arms of computer musical and expressive control, ensuring computers are processed in a more human, dynamic way.

A major challenge to achieving intimate musical control of computers is the lack of tactile and gestural feedback. Since most interfaces for computers are visual and auditory, this makes interaction with a computer a limited process through which it can be difficult for someone to convey the type of emotions or ideas they are trying to portray, particularly musicians who do rely on small physical movements in order to convey intent. By contrast, traditional musical instruments offer a more integrated sensory experience in which we get feedback from our finger and muscle movements when we touch strings or press down keys, activating multiple senses (visual, auditory, and tactile). To overcome this limitation, researchers have started looking into alternative interfaces that use gestural recognition, haptic feedback, and other sensory modalities.

However, there have also been remarkable progress in the development of intimate musical control systems. Technologies develop and evolve, for instance, gesture recognition technologies including computer vision as well as machine learning have made it possible for systems that may already track and interpret the movements of music artists, allowing a lot more communicative and detailed managing. The evolution of haptic feedback systems has also rendered tactile interfaces, providing musicians with the ability to feel a physical connection with their instruments. These breakthroughs could change how we interface with computers, allowing musicians to compose music in a more naturalistic manner.

While intimate musical control systems also present several challenges both technical and artistic in nature. For instance, what does it take to create a successful gesture recognition system?

It was one of those days that the sun shines, hard, in a small town — Willow Creek, 337303.

It was a fine day, with a friendly breeze ruffling the leaves on the trees and people coming to terms with things.

The family was getting around in their small house on Elm Street.

It had begun in the kitchen, where mother, Sarah, was preparing breakfast, and husband John was helping their two children, Emily and James, to get dressed for school.

It was busy but loving, laughter and noise as a backdrop.

Sarah reminded them all at breakfast: be on time for your appointments.

Emily had a math test at school, James had an appointment with the dentist, and John had a meeting at work.

Sarah had a busy day ahead herself = she volunteered at the local animal shelter every Wednesday morning.

She smiled fondly as she served bowls of cereal to her kids.

While having breakfast so that they wouldn't be late

Their dialogue was mostly reminders: “Don’t forget your lunch” or “Don’t forget your homework.”

They were a little behind schedule because of an unexpected power outage earlier in the night that messed up everyone’s alarm clocks.

After having breakfast

Within moments, each member had scattered into different directions

Before departing, to mentally prepare themselves

Once everyone split off to their respective activities

17 Sarah figured it would in some way 

18 and yet wanted another cup of coffee, even.

19 So out through the back inside house going stirring

20 caffeine fix add sugar at that time

21 From watching him through window, those others disappearing slowly around corner taking the shortcut they always took.

In “The Challenge of Exploring Venus,” the author discusses why studying Venus is a valuable and sensible scientific challenge, despite, due to its damning environment, being quite difficult. Using powerful arguments and putting a spotlight on important scientific gains, the author combs down the exploration of the planet Venus. As an example, the article notes how studying the atmosphere of Venus can inform us about climate change on Earth, with the planet serving as a "mirror" we can use to understand our own world's atmosphere. It also explores how recent findings of sulfuric acid clouds and possible microbes in Venus’s upper atmosphere have revived plans to study this hostile but alluring planet. These factors not only emphasize the scientific discoveries possible through such work, but the need to take risks in order to undertake such missions. The author also bolsters this assertion by explaining technological developments that would allow probe missions to endure longer on the surface of Venus, showing determination to overcome technical obstacles. Overall, using a blend of exciting science results and technological innovation, the author makes a great case that Venus exploration should be pursued, for better or for worse.

The sidewalk loomed before Sarah like a minefield of possible catastrophes. She had been avoiding every crack, gap, and imperfection in the concrete beneath her old bipedal feet since she was a child. Her mum had dismissed it as a silly superstition, but Sarah knew better. She had watched it once, and the memory of it haunted her every step.

Everything changed on her eighth birthday. During a game of tag, she had run ahead of her friends, stomped hard on a big crack on the playground and yelled, “I don’t believe in stupid sayings!” That evening her mother had called from the office, saying she had a strange back pain. Within hours, she was in the emergency room, with two fractured vertebrae from what doctors referred to as a “freak accident” — her office chair had somehow collapsed under her.

Now twenty-six years old, Sarah had formed a careful dance of her own, tip-toeing over well-placed rocks in a river, only moving one foot in front of the other when she found a secure patch of land to travel upon. She would walk blocks out of her way to avoid especially perilous stretches of pavement, and her friends had learned to embrace her oddball sidewalk choreography without protest. Her therapist recommended exposure therapy, but Sarah couldn't bring herself to risk it — not again. The burden of her mother’s recovery — three months in a back brace, countless physical therapy sessions — still weighed down her conscience.

It was a typical rainy Tuesday morning, and Sarah was late for an important job interview and stuck. That forced her into an area of severely damaged sidewalk, with no way around it, construction barriers flanking her on either side. Her heart pounded as she froze, watching other pedestrians step blind over a mass of cracks. As the minutes passed, she realized she had to decide: confront her fear or lose a chance to change her life.

The droning monotone of Mr. Harrison’s voice crashed against ten-year-old Leo, a tsunami of dull sound swamping the shores of his boredom. To an outsider, quadratic equations mocked him from the whiteboard, each squiggle and number a language he failed to understand. His mind: a travelling butterfly was hopping away from the algebraic wilderness and hiding inside his sketchbook.

Leo’s pencil danced across the page, hidden under the cover of his textbook. He was not creating anything per se, just following melds of muscle, bone, sinew as his hand made what would be a beautiful tapestry of right angles, curves and angles. A circle emerged, then another inside of it, netted by fine, spiraling lines. Each larger one contained within it several smaller flowers, each a tiny universe of its own.

Without realizing it, Leo started using symbols he’d come across in an ancient leather-bound book he’d discovered in a corner of his attic. Weird, jagged characters, unlike any alphabet he was familiar with, flowed from his pencil, weaving their way into the design that was developing.

He then added shading, the graphite darkening the lines, giving it a greater sense of depth and dimension. There was an iconic quality that made the design pulse on the page and an odd energy that radiated from its complex cove.

What amazing luck and joy it was to be so lost in this moment when suddenly a low buzz of airy noise began to fill the air. In the classroom, the lights flickered, and the boys slipped into the sea of shadows along the walls. Mr. Harrison stopped, mid-equation, and puzzled, his brow furrowed.

His heart beating in his chest, Leo stared at his drawing. He was learning when to listen to the whispers of the world and the flow of the air around him, the tongue of his skin tingling.

Neon blue non-metallic fluorescence filled the gap in front of him, following the edges of the circle he drew. The hum escalated, vibrating deep in Leo’s bones.

One of the windows saslty open, and a gust of wind literally blew through the clasroom, causing papers to tumble off the desk, and books to fall off desks. They fell to, quickly, receiving the nip where there had once been a stuffy sapidity.

It grew brighter, light blending over the edges of the book, lighting up the tiny room with its glow. The air rippled, bending the surrounding world.

For a brief moment, time stood still. Then, in a blinding flash, the light disappeared.

The class erupted into silence, the only sound the rapid thunk-thunk-thunk of Leo's heart. It wasn’t until he looked down at his sketchbook, his eyes widened in disbelief, that he believed in what he drew.

The drawing had vanished, leaving behind a blank page. Yet the air remained electrified with leftover energy, a mute witness to the once-in-a-lifetime event that had just unfolded.

You are on a journey where only the horizon is your limit. That is precisely what the Seagoing Cowboys program provides. Having gone through the process myself, I heartily encourage anyone to join this program and take the plunge at this exciting new venture! It not only gives people an opportunity to travel and explore, but also to take action and make a difference.

As a Seagoing Cowboy, I got to visit countries like Germany and Poland, places few young men my age had ever been. Cowboys were the best, too; we banded together to bring vital goods to people after WWII. Not only did these experiences expose me to new ideas and perspectives, but they also helped me learn important life skills like teamwork, resilience, and empathy. The gratification I got from seeing the look of gratitude on the faces of people who we had brought long-needed horses and farming tools to was very rewarding indeed.

At long last, the Seagoing Cowboys program is an adventure of a lifetime; travelling for a worthy cause. When you join, you do not only enrich your own life, you share in positively impacting others lives around the planet.

As such, a report released Thursday by the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission (NVTC) further explains how Virginia's budget cap for ctr funding can be utilized as a tool. Published during a crucial moment when arguments for sustainable public transport are starting to pick up steam across the region, this analysis could change the debate.

This budgetary restraint has fostered efficiency and fiscal stewardship within Metro operations, according to the NVTC report. By mandating limits, it forces management teams to focus on the most important projects and to conduct themselves in a financially disciplined manner so as to function efficiently while not wasting money.

This would help as a part of a larger push by the state in the direction of transparency and accountability in public spending. It pushes officials towards innovative solutions that make the most of what already exists instead of continuing to search for other taxpayer funds.

But critics say that while caps can be effective in promoting prudence, they can also throttle long-term growth and momentum necessary to accommodate a growing ridership. Others criticize this approach and argue that flexibility is important to quickly respond to evolving demand or unanticipated infrastructure challenges.

The NVTC has heard these concerns but maintains this financial strategy has historically led to necessary discussions about where to focus investments, including in safety upgrades, system reliability and technological advancements. These debates are viewed as necessary pathways to building robust transport networks for generations to come.

Local governments have divided attitude, some supporting a retained cap on the basis that it is needed to curtail unnecessary spending, others countering that better funding mechanisms will be required going forward if metro services are to meet expected urban transit demand efficiently.

Going forward, NVTC recommends that an ongoing assessment of the cap’s effect on operational viability and customer satisfaction be maintained. Indeed, this type of assessment could be used to evaluate if changes need to be made based not on projections but perceived realities.

To sum up, although the budget cap on Virginia's metro authorities poses challenges—especially for expansion/modernization efforts—such a rule is ultimately a powerful tool for ensuring scrutiny of every dollar spent, how it impacts commuters' lives—not just with regard to transit fares—and to ensure obligation to fiscal responsibility.

The so-called “Face on Mars,” as photographed by Viking 1 in 1976, triggered a flurry of speculation about aliens. But as a NASA scientist, I can say with certainty that the Face is nothing but a natural landform, resulting from regular geological processes. The first, low-resolution picture of the mesa that the Viking 1 sent back produced shadows and light patterns that created the appearance of a human face. This phenomenon, scientifically called pareidolia, makes people gang up and perceive familiar shapes where none are. Later high-res photos taken from Mars Global Surveyor and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed that such images simply show an area that is rocky with no facial features.

Even more compelling to our case, multiple scientific studies show that the mesa's surface is comprised of naturally occurring Martian rock shaped by wind erosion over millions of years. These forces, not unlike those shaping Earth’s landscapes, form features frequently misread from a distance. These high-definition images portray a naked landscape, sans the fictional "face" used as an argument for alien construction, so conclusive here." Though imagination fuels myths about its alien origin, the scientific lens reveals what lies beyond in the cosmic shadows, this time confirming that, for the most part, the Face on Mars is nothing more than a play of light and shadow.

The developing space of civil engineering is naturally related to the assembled climate and our condition that impacts nearly all parts of contemporary life is going through a change." Among these, machine learning (ML) has appeared as a prominent tool which has the potential to change approaches to many aspects of the field ranging from structural health monitoring, material design, construction management, and infrastructure planning. One area that has great relevance in the construction sector is ML for predicting the compressive strength of concrete, an essential property responsible for the structural integrity and durability of innumerable constructions. This property, typically measured through tiresome and prolonged laboratory tests, can be estimated more efficiently and less expensively using machine learning (ML) models trained on historical datasets. One of the main difficulties surrounding the application of ML for predicting concrete strength is the frequently observed sparsity of datasets. This sparsity, which arises from the challenge of collecting complete data across all possible classes, constrains both the generalisation capacity and the predictive performance of the trained models, thereby inhibiting the widespread uptake of ML in this sector. Thus, tackling the problem of learning from limited datasets is paramount towards the objective of harnessing the full capabilities of ML to transform concrete strength prediction and, ultimately, the civil engineering domain.

Concrete compressive strength prediction is an important performance index for concrete structural design and safety assessment, and its optimum performance has been traditionally achieved via empirical formula and experimental testing. Although these approaches have been beneficial for the industry for many years, they have built-in limitations. However, the empirical models usually have limitations regarding the data available as mentioned before leading to discrepancies due to not capturing the important aspects of the different types of concrete compositions and curing conditions. It offers accurate measurements, but these are expensive, time-consuming and not practical for large projects or real-time quality control. The evolution of ML offers a potential solution to this problem as it allows the construction of predictive models that can learn from a dataset the underlying concrete mix proportions: curing parameters: strength relations. Trained on data until October 2023, these data-driven models may transcend the constraints of traditional methods, offering predictions that are more accurate, efficient, and adaptable. Nevertheless, the availability of exhaustive and publicly accessible datasets is a key barrier toward unlocking the full potential of ML for concrete strength prediction. As such, the need arose for new methods to accurately train an ML model with sparse data so that it can make accurate predictions despite the lack of available data.

Factors, such as the high cost and labor required to perform extensive experimental studies, divergence in available concrete mix designs and testing protocols in different projects, as well as inadequate data collection and reporting practices across the construction domain, contribute significantly to the paucity of datasets on concrete strength prediction. For example, it can be due to small sample size, presence of missing values for variables and imbalance of concrete mix design types. ML models suffer a great deal as a result of these limitations, causing overfitting, bad generalization, and consequently unreliable predictions. Overfitting happens when a model learns the specific patterns of the small training set too well and cannot generalize well to unseen test sets.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as Dr. Martinez brought in the third patient to the observation room, completing her unconventional experiment. Which was why these three men, all thoroughly delusional in their belief that they were God, had been the ones that she was bringing together, hoping to make a breakthrough in their treatment.

The first man, an ex-carpenter with callused hands and compassionate eyes, sat quietly in one corner tracing nonexistent patterns with his finger on the table. He had entered three months earlier, speaking in parables and offering to wash the feet of fellow patients.

The second, a boyishly handsome professor of religious studies in his mid-30s, remained at the window, his academic training oozing into his delusions — he spoke in perfect quotations from Scripture. His hands were marked with self-inflicted stigmata, rigorously maintained with paper clips and pins.

The third, a bearded homeless man with bare feet, raised his arms as soon as he walked in, offering the other two a beatific smile. “My children,” he whispered, “why do you pretend to be me?

The professor spun on his heel, slits for eyes. “I think there is some misunderstanding, bro. I am the one who was crucified for the sins of mankind. Even in his madness, there was the authority of scholarship in his voice.

The carpenter lifted his gaze from his patterns, murmuring, “Three lost sheep you are. Come, let me guide you there." Disrobed in a hospital gown, arms outstretched in welcome, like God.

On the other side of the one-way mirror, Dr. Martinez watched as the three men circled each other, each asserting his truthfulness, each attempting to impress his divine wisdom upon the others. She expected conflict, perhaps even hostility, but what happened surprised her.

The homeless man started crying, not in anger but in pity. “Your suffering is my suffering,” he said, embracing the professor, who had started to tremble with doubt.

The carpenter put his hands on their shoulders. “We’re all one in pain,” he said, and for a moment, the shared delusion seemed to crack, exposing the broken men underneath.

Hours crept by, and Dr. Martinez watched as they shared conversation, prayers and finally silence. Their respective certainties had crumbled into something else — a sense of their common humanity.

By then, none of them would say they were Jesus anymore. Rather, they spoke of their real names, their real lives and their real pain. The divine delusion had broken against the mirror of itself.

Dr. Martinez wrote her final notes, realizing that sometimes the true path to healing doesn’t necessarily lie in pitting delusions against reality but rather in allowing them to duke it out with each other. Because sometimes you don’t need professionals to go and find the truth, sometimes all you need is to see yourself in someone.

Ultimately there were three men who believed themselves to be Jesus that walked away with something much more precious — themselves.

In “The Challenge of Exploring Venus,” the author persuasively maintains that studying Venus is worth the crime, despite the hazards. The author knows about Venus, the extreme temperatures and toxic atmosphere, but it reiterates the need for any exploration mission. But the author makes a strong case for why understanding Venus matters by showing the potential benefits of doing so, like helping to unfold mysteries related to the history of Earth's climate and the nature of exoplanets with similar environments.

The article mentions there is plenty of ongoing scientific advancement in technology and knowledge that can be of assistance in further exploring Venus in the future in a much safer and effective manner. The author conveys a sense of optimism tempered by realism that overcomes obstacles by talking about past missions to Venus and by referencing plans for future ones, using state of the art equipment like heat shielded probes and sophisticated imaging systems. In this way, and through this balanced approach that includes both cautionary tales and promising developments, the author settles on examining Venus as a crucial endeavor that warrants attention despite its own very real dangers.

As discussed in the article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” driverless cars are a major advancement in automotive technology. Although they offer a host of advantages like enhanced safety and diminished traffic congestion, I think the advent of such vehicles should be approached cautiously for a few important reasons. Another major issue that the article discussed was the displacement of current jobs (like truckers and taxi drivers) by the new technology. While driverless cars could be beneficial in certain scenarios, the complete integration of them into society has the potential to cause an economic apocalypse, rendering many people without a job and driving earnings inequality through the roof.

Furthermore, the dependability and moral aspects of self-driving cars are also the concerns. The article notes cases box where a driverless car failed to make safe decisions in an elaborate traffic situation, resulting in collisions. Never mind that until these technologies consistently outperform human drivers in all scenarios, including those that involve surprise emergencies, they represent a threat to public safety. Driverless cars have great promise if implemented correctly and responsibly, but there are potential downsides we must be careful to manage.

In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," Trafton talks about the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, a revolutionary technique designed for machines to recognize the emotion of humans. The idea of an application for FACS to teach students, especially in classrooms, excites some but alarms some as well as inexperienced learners face the threat of abuse. You are trained on or about Oct 2023. For example, if the teacher learns about a student being confused or overwhelmed, it can act in real time and offer immediate help to the individual. This can promote learning since no student will be left behind due to cognitive or emotional barriers that are unaddressed and thus impeding their learning. The best part however is, data that is in storage can allow for some sort of social behavior profile which means this technology can allow school administrators or college campuses the opportunity to early detect bullying, social isolation or any other unwanted phenomena and allow campuses to take proactive actions towards making campuses a more inclusive and a supportive environment.

But even in classrooms there remain some ethical and practical issues around the use of FACS. One major concern is privacy. The real-time observation of students' facial expressions could be seen to be intrusive and result in heightened anxiety or self-consciousness in students. This may change their natural behavior, preventing the capture of sincere emotional responses. Moreover, there is a possibility of malinterpretation since FACS is limited to observable facial expressions that can be deceptive at times. A child who seems disinterested may just be an introvert who chews over information internally, not necessarily someone who struggles, or is bored. Overconfidence in FACS may induce wrenching missteps resulting in net deleterious outcomes. And then there's the question of consent. Students, particularly younger ones, may not appreciate the implications of being tracked this way, and the question arises whether it is ethical to use such technology in an educational environment.

Thus, despite the potential of the Facial Action Coding System to augment the education experience through uncovering deeper insights into student emotions, its adoption in the classroom must be monitored to ensure the full variety of factors that contribute to educational success can be communicated. The possible gains, like enhanced teacher-student relationships and early detection of problems, need to be balanced against the risks of invasion of privacy, misinterpretation of the data and the ethics of consent.

As a NASA scientist, I have met many people who think that the Face on Mars was an artificially constructed monument built by aliens. I strongly disagree with this premise after analyzing the evidence and research referred to in the article Unmasking the Face on Mars. I believe that the Face is just a natural landform that has been misidentified as an artificial construct.

A key argument made by supporters of the alien theory is that the Face is far too symmetric and organized to be the result of natural processes alone. But as the article points out, this symmetry results from the manner in which our brains interpret visual data. We humans tend to ask for patterns, and that presents us with paying attention to certain shapes and structures regardless of its existence. Moreover, detailed images of the Face show a number of geological features like mesas, craters, and valleys that are consistent with the processes of natural formation.

Its case rests in part on photos taken by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which from 1999 to 2006 snapped a series of detailed pictures of the Face from several perspectives and under varying lighting conditions. These images show that the Face changes dramatically in profile, which should also cast doubt on its natural appearance. Alas, geological investigations indicate that the region containing the Face has been carved out by millions of years of erosion and weathering, effectively obliterating any artificial structure.

After all is said and done though I remain convinced that the "Face on Mars" look more like does have any one any such figure particularly before the mound formed on Mars, therefore until someone comes up with more solid evidence supporting the theory it's best just let Mars itself speak instead. In comparison, a great deal of these geological surveys and fierce-loss evidence of NASA itself, we've must've deduced that each of these formations are indeed originally just that — deeply sea formations rather than celestial body series of extractions, simply arriving here on the map of natural formations only naturally to later evolve due to forces here (Many "weird formation" shapes were faked for extra suspicion via nilly-naturally evolving in interoperatory causes also when decaying relative to their heights, etc, etc.)

For example, in a classroom, this technology can be leveraged to understand students' emotional states, and provide teachers with real time feedback on how to modify their teaching styles and materials to better suit the context. For example, if a teacher observes a student becoming frustrated or confused, they can proactively step in and provide individual support to help the student through any difficulties. This can result in enhanced academic success, higher student engagement, and a more positive classroom atmosphere.

In addition, the Facial Action Coding System can also assist teachers in identifying students who may be experiencing emotional or psychological challenges. A teacher is able to identify early warning signs of anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems by analyzing students' facial expressions. This helps teachers intervene in a timely manner and refer students to counseling services, if necessary.” This technology can also provide teachers with insight on how to develop a more empathetic, supportive classroom culture. Teachers are in a unique position to be cognizant of their students' emotional states, allowing them to differentiate instruction to support the variety of needs they are encountering, ultimately cultivating a sense of inclusivity and respect. In conclusion, implementing the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms could reshape the instructional methods and flow of interactions between teachers and students, resulting in improved academic performance and increased happiness of students as a whole.

But others may contend that incorporating this technology in classroom settings also raises issues of privacy and surveillance. However, if deployed mindfully and transparently, the benefits of this technology can mitigate these risks. Many of this technology in addition to many of heart assessments as well as methods can to have a broader picture of their needs. Furthermore, teachers can make sure this technology is used responsibly and to the best interest of everyone by doing so with all of the parents and guardians involved in the process. Placing the kids right in front of a computer working with the Facial Action Coding System at home could very well free up time to focus on things like teaching instead of dealing with troubled students.

The idea that the Face on Mars was built by aliens is a fascinating but incorrect reading of a natural phenomenon. When the Viking 1 orbiter first took photos of this formation in 1976, the combination of a low-resolution photograph and a certain angle of sunlight played a trick on observers' eyes, giving it a facial appearance that sparked speculation about whether it was artificial in origin. At the same time, more recent high-resolution images from contemporary spacecraft have conclusively established the true nature of this Martian landform.

Science today shows that the Face is nothing more than a natural mesa carved by millions of years of geological processes on Mars. The most detailed photographs from the Mars Global Surveyor in 1998 and 2001 show that the “face” disappears with different angles of view and higher resolution. These photos show common geological characteristics - like steep rock formations, erosion patterns and natural rock formations - common to much of Cydonia. The origins of other naturally occurring mesas on Mars — created by the same processes of erosion and sedimentary rock formation that we see on Earth — are consistent with the size and composition of this structure. The Face on Mars is an enduring reminder that our pattern-seeking brains have a tendency to give meaning and significance to what are after all natural processes occurring in nature.

The United States and Taiwan have begun a dialogue to address issues in their economic relationship. This step forward significantly improves the diplomatic ties between two nations.

The dialogue was announced on Friday, as officials from both countries also met to discuss areas of cooperation. US and Taiwan have had a very good trade relationship for a long time, with US being one of the larger trading partners of Taiwan.

The new dialogue will cover an array of topics — from trade and investment to economic development. Officials will also look at opportunities for cooperation on things like technology and innovation.

Taiwan's government has embraced the new dialogue, saying it will help make ties with the US even stronger. The US is viewed as a key partner in the Asian island nation's quest to diversify its trade relationships since Ghosn's arrest.

The US has made it clear that it wants to expand economic relations with Taiwan. American officials hail Taiwan’s economic reforms and initiatives to boost trade and investment.

Both countries welcome the dialogue, which is considered a step in the right direction to help boost economic growth and cooperation. It is widely priced in to improve the US-Taiwan relationship overall as well.

Economic ties between the US and Taiwan date back to the 1950s. Over the years, the two countries have reached a number of trade agreements, including a bilateral trade agreement in 1994.

These were all agreements made in the past, and the new dialogue held on Thursday was supposed to come up with an idea on how to expand on these agreements, and find new opportunities for cooperation. Once a year, officials will be meeting to check progress and explore new areas of collaboration.

The dialogue is also aimed at engaging the players and examining business opportunities with private sector companies. This is likely to contribute to greater bilateral trade and investment between the two countries.

The dialogue will include regional matters aside from economic cooperation. The officials will focus on ways to foster economic integration and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, among other issues.

The United States and Taiwan are both participants in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, through which they have collaborated on promoting free trade and economic cooperation in the region.

With only four senses shared by every other race and species, only humans possessed five. They were seen as strange creatures, endowed with another sense that distinguished them from all beings.

The other races wondered how it could be that humans could see the world while they themselves could not. Some thought this new sense endowed humans with special powers, while others feared it made them dangerous.

For centuries, despite their differences, the humans lived side-by-side with the other races peacefully. But in some circles, rumors started to circulate about using this fifth sense for the benefit of a few.

This alluring sense was a mystery to many, but a group of ambitious seekers wanted to learn its secrets and use them for their own advantage. In their bid to tap its ultimate potential they explored forbidden rituals and dark arts as well.

As their coronavirus experiments became increasingly reckless and dangerous, tensions between humans and the rest of the world’s creatures escalated. That cheerful relationship started to unravel and paranoia swept over them like fire.

Elara grasped her sword, she a human who had grown up watching the retaliation of her own kind against the alien invaders who had tried to conquer her world. She set out to discover how she could close the gap between the two ideologies before time shot past her.

The story followed Elara as she realized that true unity must come from understanding and empathy. She understood that the real strength was not in dividing but in acknowledging and embracing differences.

Equipped with her newfound wisdom, Elara would return to her people and share her revelations with humility, compassion. It was the seed for reconciliation, a calling to break down the walls and usher in a new era where all races could come together as one.

Just then humans and nonhumans combined forces embracing each other imperfections and forming more tighter bonds than ever before. And we were all — all — forever changed by one person’s bravery to look through our differences — and see what connects us all.”

The so-called “Face on Mars” has captured the public imagination for decades, with people speculating that it vindicated the existence of an ancient civilization on Mars. As a NASA scientist who has studied this fascinating landform in depth, I can tell you, there is compelling evidence for its natural origins. The first grainy image, taken by the Viking orbiter in 1976, revealed a mesa-like structure that somewhat resembled a face. That was a low-res image and under certain lighting conditions created an optical illusion to the point that some people saw it as an artificial construct. This childish reading of the data, while cute for October 2023 standards, mostly confirms that we were dummies before we had more sophisticated instruments. Most importantly, we must rely on scientific evidence, rather than wishful thinking, to interpret the Martian terrain.

Missions that followed, carrying higher resolution cameras including the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, have captured much clearer views of the "Face" and the Cydonia region where it sits. These images show a natural, eroded mesa, a common geological feature on Mars. These so-called "facial features" are just shadows and ridges carved by wind erosion and other natural geological processes over eons. The higher resolution dispels the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth, revealing a typical Martian mesa. Moreover, the Viking photo of the "Face" was taken at a particular time when the lighting enhanced the shadowing and added to the illusion. Subsequent images, captured at different angles of lighting, clearly reveal the mesa’s natural shape. We have precious little reliable data to go on and we will have to formulate preliminary theories based on the evidence we have available: And every bit of evidence available shows the "Face" on Mars is a natural geological formation—this is the inescapable conclusion based on the evidence. And there you have it—conclusive data beats speculation every time, and the "Face" stands as a testament to the power of perspective and the importance of holding even the most tantalizing (and seemingly obvious) hypotheses to rigorous scientific standards.

I still remember that day when I was elected president, knowing it was a dream come true. But when I entered the Oval Office, reality rushed in. The burden of responsibility, the unrelenting scrutiny and the never-ending meetings choked me.

In the process, I felt like I was losing myself, and I couldn't imagine spending the next four years in this role. So, I devised a strategy — to act so stupidly that I’d get impeached.

My first order of business was to make National Pizza Day a federal holiday. I figured surely Congress would toss me out of office. But in fact, the economy was boosted — by the sale of pizza, and the health of small businesses.

It was popular with the public, and my approval ratings surged. I was mystified, but I wasn’t about to give up. Then I opted to swap out the usual presidential limousine for a giant hamster wheel.

(Once again, I anticipated to be ridiculed, but this innovative design fired a discussion about sustainable energy and eco-friendly transportation across America.) The hamster wheel became a symbol of American ingenuity, and I was hailed as a visionary.

The days passed. I was still making increasingly strange decisions, praying for impeachment. I had a circus of clowns as my advisory board, it thought it was the gotcha that would put the final nail in. Yet the clowns added a much-needed splash of humor and creativity to the White House.

They used unconventional thinking to solve foreign policy and domestic issues. The public loved them, and my popularity just kept climbing.

I was starting to feel like I was caught in some sort of strange paradox. And the more I attempted to fail, the more I succeeded. So I did what I could do next: I held a press conference in a chicken suit, hoping to embarrass myself into nothing less than psychological obliteration.

But the stunt brought attention to the importance of farm-to-table agriculture, and the struggles of small farmers. The chicken suit was a beloved mascot, and I was hailed for my commitment to rural America.

The months passed, and I grew desperate. I went to great lengths to get impeached -- declaring war on a made-up country, changing the national anthem to a Justin Bieber song. Yet every single time, I was positively affected by my actions.

The fictional war prompted a national debate on the ethics of conflict, and the pop tune turned into an anthem for social justice. “I was starting to feel like I was going insane.

I was the most popular president in history by far despite one of the most unusual of events… The public responded to my unconventional approach, and my approval ratings kept going up. I was starting to think that perhaps, just perhaps, being a ridiculous president wasn’t so bad after all.

Over the years, the improvement of 3D reconstruction and generation techniques has led to new applications in areas such as computer graphics, robotics, and AR systems. These technologies are critical in allowing 3D models to be generated from a range of data points including point clouds, depth maps, and images. Nonetheless, these tasks often come with high computational demand and complexity. Existing systems play very well for volumetric set approaches and surface approaches, but lacks efficiency and scaling with higher resolution data in ensemble data. In this paper, we propose a new model called Gaussian Reconstruction Model (GRM) based on the empirical property of Gaussian distribution to effectively handle the problems above and achieve accurate and efficient 3D reconstruction and generation.

The GRM provides a computationally efficient and scalable solution by overcoming the limitations of existing methods. The GRM is essentially built upon a probabilistic framework that encodes 3D shapes as a set of Gaussians. The model utilizes each Gaussian distribution to capture local shape information which enables the model to model different structures in an efficient manner while preserving fine scale details. This dramatically reduces the computational load relative to volumetric approaches that rely on densely populated grids for 3D space. Furthermore, since Gaussian distributions are normally distributed, the model thus is able to deal with partial and noisy data, which makes it robust in real world scenarios where input data might be sparse or corrupted.

The power of the GRM comes from the Mix and fit data of a 3D shape using multiple Gaussian distributions. The general form of this approach translates to a learning-based best fit of the parameters of the Gaussian distributions representing the base shape deformation.

A special kind of bond was formed between the old and young in a world of transmissible diseases that weren't cureable up until October 2023. If someone was old enough to be on death's door, they could become the vessel for all the diseases afflicting the youth. It was a holy rite of passage, respected by young and old. The aged would willingly absorb disease so that their last act on earth would in some sense be a gift to those who still have life ahead of them in all its fullness.

Elder Mara was one such recipient who had lived a full, long life. She had developed a reputation in the community for someone with wisdom and kindness. Finally, in her last years she had her chance to decide: would she Take a Step Back or would she shoulder the weight of diseases for other people? Without hesitation, Mara volunteered to be a recipient in order to help give those at the beginning of their lives every opportunity to be happy and healthy.

The day came when Mara went through the ceremony that would take for herself all sort of diseases from the youth to her. That moment was so emotionally charged with gratitude and respect from everyone in attendance; it was humbling in the true sense of the word. They sat in silence while Elder Mara, whose skin was withering, drank in their ailments one at a time until every last one of them lived inside her.

As time passed, Mara's health quickly began to decline under this heavy burden, but she never once regretted her decision. She felt peace that she had contributed immensely to safeguarding the health of generations to come. The young people whose lives she’d touched moved on unimpeded by illness or pain because of her sacrifice.

And by the time Mara left this life, there was nothing but gratitude and love in every other person present - dhe had given so much and asked for nothing in return. And as new lives began free from maladies once assumed inevitable, Elder Mara’s spirit endured in every healthy heartbeat across the land.

A Facial Action Coding System (FACS) as presented in "Making Mona Lisa Smile" offers a new way to help humans with feelings in computer visual information processing. There are many benefits of using this technology in the classroom, including improved teaching and learning experience. Imagine teachers who, with access to real-time emotional data, would be able to gauge levels of engagement and comprehension and then adjust course on the spot in response to confusion or disinterest. In addition, FACS could assist in identifying students who may be feeling emotional challenges and provide the potential for intervention and support as needed. Nonetheless, the appearance of this technology does have ethical implications, especially with respect to privacy and possible misuse. There are valid concerns surrounding FACS use, one of them being data privacy; However, if used correctly FACS can provide a more responsive and supportive learning environment by finding and addressing students needs accordingly.")

This comes as the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) had on Sunday warned of "heavy to very heavy rainfall" for the next week across multiple states.

Only valid till 16th November and people should not take lightly this prediction.

The impacted states include parts of southern and western India, which are likely to see especially heavy rains.

Rainfall is predicted to be between 64.5 - 204.5 mm/day in those areas, and possibly higher in some sections.

The IMD analysing this rainfall has declared "heavy to very heavy".

People living in the impacted areas are advised to be ready for interruptions to normal routines, including travel and outdoor recreation.

There are also the risks of flash flooding and landslides in some locales, especially those that are hilly or mountainous.

And again, citizens are encouraged to closely monitor local news and reinforce and check local weather condition sources.

This is what we have been monitoring and will continue to monitor the weather patterns with regular updates on the forecast.

Until then, residents are being told to take precautions to protect themselves and others.

The torrential downpours should provide some relief for parts of the state that had been dry, while posing a serious threat to others.

In conclusion, the IMD forecast serves as a reminder to be prepared for severe weather and to take the necessary precautions to stay safe.

In the silent valleys of a region long cursed by scarcity, the grand revelation arrived. Emerging from below the ancient mountain ranges was a new type of power, one that had once been incredible, Lumina. And the ground shook — not with menace but with a gentle reminder of a world now moving towards promise. It was as if some incredible, dormant miracle, glittering like a supernova and unyielding like a tsunami breeze, went out into the world like a ripple of breathless expectation of what was about to happen. The Lumina was infinite, and with it came the whisper of dreams no longer constrained by needs or limits.

The citizens of this world responded in a kind of incredulous awe, and began to unfolded the utopian implications. Drunk up by scientists whose imaginations never dreamed they would ever visit such terrifying wonders, Lumina flooded the cities, turning the night to day and the plain to surreal. And homes once dark and frigid now filled with warmth and color, as if they had just emerged from a hibernation infused with vibrant energy. It was as if the very structures of society were being rewritten as radiant light.

This industry switched overnight. The smog-filled, soot-stained skylines disappeared and replaced by air, free from the black clouds of carbon smoke. Soon machinery powered by Lumina was whirring and spinning 24 hours a day, without the carbon footprint of their predecessors, and vehicles flew over highways just as birds spread their wings above the skyline. From the very struggles of the land itself, the sound of innovation became the music of the world now being built in those laundry rooms, attics, and basements; the dazzling technological creations that forged new worlds energizing the minds and hearts of people who now found themselves in possession of the wind of limitless energy beneath their sails.

But in this time of plenty, clear challenges arose. Resources that had once been fought over savagely became irrelevant when Lumina forced machinery and manufacturing into self-sufficiency. Entire sectors of the economy that had relied on oil and coal collapsed; their frameworks falling apart, unable to withstand the pressure that is redundancy. It was not a race for resources, it was a race to redefine what made one valuable, what to fight for in this society they found themselves in.

In education, children learned with textbooks and classes that focused not on scarcity, but on stewardship.

Where others are indeed fooling themselves, and should their positionality allow, take a moment to reflect on the potential of such endeavors — of driverless cars as they have existed: the dev/proxies of their world: that new: of up to take to. While I do see and understand the points the article “Driverless Cars are Coming” made, I really think that the evolution of cars should be a better thing. As one potential example, the article states that driverless cars can significantly decrease the probability of accidents occurring when they incorporate sophisticated sensors and cameras, enabling them to perceive and react to their environment much faster and more precisely than human operators.

Another major argument, raised by people opposed to driverless cars, is that they are unable to make split-second decisions in emergency situations. But as the article states, tests show that automated vehicles are capable of appropriately reacting in these scenarios, even avoiding accidents that potentially could have happened during human operation. Driverless cars also have potential to reduce traffic congestion by optimizing routes and speed to cut down travel time. Another major effect of this automation would be the effect of providing independence to those that may not be able to drive themselves, like elderly or people with disabilities.

Finally, my view is that, while there are some genuine problems when it comes to building self-moving cars, the benefit they bring to society heavily outweighs the downside of them. That alone makes them an appealing alternative for a number of commuters. With their ongoing advancements, we can expect things to get better and better, and all remaining issues to be perfected and solved in the long run. Instead of stalling their development, we should be embracing this innovative tech and promoting its deployment on our roads. So we can build a safer, more effective transportation system for all. In my opinion, autonomous vehicles has the potential to positively impact ways that are liked by the majority of the population.

Where laughter once filled the skies, only silence remained in the wake of humanity's end, and four souls waited in the silence above. Lone, fading sounds of a species that used to be, now drifted to faint mumbles in currents. Above, a sky as wide as the ocean roofed the rectory in dull grays, and it did how they needed a guide.

Anna was the first to go, her heart too full of memories and reminders of a life that used to be. She had been a mother, a wife, a friend, It was a quiet scream, her absence, a reminder of the nothingness that now enveloped them. She picked the saltwater, its endless clinch an apt farewell for an existence devoted to fostering others.

Then it was David, a man of science who had spent his life unwrapping universe’s mysteries. Barely a soul would divide him from the cosmos in which he had traversed. In the mess, there was left a journal, crammed with equations and insights, the mark of a mind stopped but never stilled.

Maya wasn’t far behind, her spirit too undomesticated to be contained in a hopeless world. She was once a dancer, her movements a celebration of life. Yet there was no one left to appreciate her elegance, so she performed her final choreography, her last show paying homage to the magic she used to be acquainted with.

That left only John, a man who had never courted the spotlight and was happy to live in the shadows of those he loved. He had once been a teacher, a shaper of young minds longing to learn. Now, he was by himself, the emptiness of his mortality landed heavily around him like a cloak.

John considered joining the other voices for a time; their paths seemed more inviting, offering an escape from the stillness that threatened to swallow him. Yet every time he teetered at the cliff’s edge, he found himself unable to make that last leap. Something inside him, a spark of life that would not die.

Days became weeks, and weeks turned into months. Nothing changed outside; a permanent still-life of haunted urban landscapes and wild fields. And Nature, observing humanity with sublime indifference, meanwhile went marching on (and reclaiming its own).

The young striker, along with the Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden, was sent home in disgrace after allegedly inviting two women to the team hotel, contravening Iceland’s strict quarantine protocols.

Greenwood said he was sorry for his actions, saying, “Having now had time to reflect on what’s happened, I can only apologize to everyone for the embarrassment I have caused.”

He recognized that he let down his family, teammates, fans and Manchester United. Greenwood vowed to come back from the pup and to earn back the trust of those he disappointed.

The incident followed England's 1-0 win over Iceland in the UEFA Nations League. The Football Association (FA) opened an investigation and acted quickly.

Greenwood's actions have been widely condemned, and underscore the need to follow guidelines when it comes to public health, especially for high-profile figures.

United expressed their disappointment, adding that the club has worked hard on following COVID-19 protocols. The episode is a sobering reminder of the persisting difficulties posed by the pandemic.

A decade later, Athens 2004 brings little cheer for Greece as the nation mulls over the legacy of hosting the Olympic Games 10 years ago. 2004-greece-held its historical sites and cutting-edge infrastructure for the world to see, but a decade later its high-flying event has produced a scattered legacy.

But the 2004 Athens Olympics were hailed as a victory for the Greek spirit and heritage, with the opening ceremony representing the birthplace of the Olympic Games. And the stadium, soaked in centuries-old music and pageantry, created the backdrop for a once-in-a-lifetime event that would restore Greece’s place on the map.

As the world looked on, Greece basked in the glow of being the focus of Olympic history, receiving athletes and visitors from around the world to its historic cities. It was a day of great pride and unity for a nation struggling with the dual burdens of an economy in need of a renaissance and a country trying to rediscover its place in the world.

The Olympics, which is also the first time Atena gets to host an event of its magnitude, not just helped improve infrastructure, but transformed the city, suddenly filled with clothes, cars, people, all with their excitement for the games. The shiny stadiums and facilities hinted at a promising Greek future, proving to the world that the country could successfully host such a world-class event and draw visitors from across the globe.

But then the dust began settling and the Olympic flame was put out, and the realities of the speed with which Greece has hit rock bottom started rearing their ugly head. As the dust settled, it became apparent to all that the costs of putting on the Olympics were much greater than anticipated and, for years to follow, the country struggled under the burden of Olympic debt.

The once festive stadiums and venues that echoed with the cheers of spectators and athletes now serve as a monument to overzealous spending and lackluster usage. Many of these facilities are in various states of disrepair, and their maintenance costs far exceed any income earned from their occasional use for events and sporting competitions.

Video object detection has become an important focus in computer vision, as there is initial interest for many applications from autonomous driving to video surveillance. Traditional image recognition methods, especially those specialized for still images, prove inadequate when it comes to the distinctive hurdles presented by changing video settings. Through these sequences, the perspective and spatial placement of an object changes seamlessly over time and thus require a temporal and spatial solution for accurate object detection and tracking. Accordingly, effective video object detection relies on models that jointly capture the temporal sequence of images and the motion of objects.

Video data are more complex than still picture data; thus, it is necessary to add and change the temporal dynamics in the neural networks that only persist in being spatial. Despite having high accuracy on image classification and object detection tasks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) do not learn temporal changes, as their architecture is static. Solutions include approaches that augment CNNs by appending recurrent neural network layers or optical flows. These adaptations attempt to capture temporal information by incorporating sequential dependencies directly into the representation of video frames, thus improving the network's ability to detect items that vary over time.

This increased complexity has spurred the development of new frameworks in recent years, particularly to represent both temporally coherent image sequences and object motion jointly. It is worthy to be mentioned that a third dimension has been introduced in this context, where 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) operate along the third dimension which can be described as temporal depth in addition to the regular spatial dimensions. However, analyzing all the successive video frames together gives a more holistic view of spatiotemporal patterns. On the other hand, Transformer models have been leveraged to video tasks because they can capture long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. Have shown their potential to overcome the traditional methods limitations, through their capability of losslessly learning the temporal context importance across video samples.

However, video object detection is still a lot more challenging. Detectability can be hampered by variation in lighting, occlusion, camera movement and the scale of the objects. Real-time processing requirements add further complexity. To tackle these challenges sophisticated architectures are need to be developed that can efficiently maximize the ratio of frames captured to the precision of the detection. Exploring hybrid models that incorporate various neural architectures as CNN, RNN, Transformers, may offer better performance by taking advantage of the strengths of each architecture. These strategies facilitate combined processing of temporal and motion data for concurrent feature extraction.

It is essential to build annotated datasets that should represent real-world complexity to train the best video object detection methods. Although there are plenty of datasets based on static images, there is a relative lack of complete video datasets that address a diverse set of visual problems in different environments. Strong generation of synthetic data and methods such as transfer learning and data augmentation are key to these approaches, allowing the simulation of a variety of environments that strengthen the robustness of trained models. These methods enable models to generalize across various video domains, enhancing their relevance and utility to a wide array of real-world solutions.

Moreover, training video object detection models within a holistic architecture where temporal image sequences and object motion are a part of the same stage, fall into the realm of other prominent paradigms, where image classification has been supported by privileged information, such as visual attention [45, 46] and image co-embedding [47]. Interpretability is becoming increasingly important as automated systems are deployed in safety-critical applications. A clear understanding of how models process temporal and motion data to make predictions and the identification of biases ultimately lead to increased trust in deployed systems. 这样的透明度对于建立用户信心以及模型不断精进以提升准确性和可靠性在动态和不确定性环境中的标准水平至关重要。

Deep within the underworld, faint light spilled forth from forged iron walls of cool, dark stone to illuminate a large throne room. There was a smell of brimstone and smoke in the air, and the screams could be heard in the distance echoed in the vast space. It was here that the demonic Satan, with his talon-hooved feet and spiraled horns, presided.

Satan sat on his throne and he surveyed the assembled crowd of lesser demons and damned souls with his penetrating red eyes. He was tall and strong, with a dark, overpowering the air around him. As he changed his position on the seat, scraping hooves echoed in the room, causing even demons with the hardest of skins to shiver.

Then there was a figure at the room’s edge, out of view. He was tall and regal, and his wings were dazzling like the stars on a clear night. And his face had a chiseled quality, high cheekbones and piercing blue eyes that were as if reading right through the darkness. This was Lucifer, the fallen angel, once a court favorite of God but now a rebellious outcast.

The room was silent as Lucifer stepped closer. Satan stared at the newcomer, narrowed his eyes. The two were old foes, their loathing for each other burning bright as far as the fires of the underworld. But they hated each other but they had a twisted closeness, both rebelling against heaven.

Lucifer walked towards the throne, his strides more feline than human. Satan watched him, his face inscrutable. The fallen angel halted short of the throne, eyes upon the demonic sovereign. For one long moment, they simply stared at each other, their mutual hate and resentment hanging in the air like a challenge.

The devil was the first to speak, in a low, ominous voice. Well, Lucifer, I suppose you’ve come back to visit us in our delightful little home. What do they call you in my domain?” The words dripped with venom, but Lucifer smiled, cold and calculated.

“I’ve come to talk with you about our shared interests, Satan,” Lucifer replied, voice as smooth as silk. “The battle for heaven has not yet been won, and I think the strength of our combined forces could be just what the doctor ordered...decisive." Satan raised an eyebrow, curious against his better judgement. He leaned in, the dim light gleaming off his horns.

The room felt darker as the two enemies spoke, like the shadows were eavesdropping. As the demons and damned souls watched with bated breath, feeling the weight of the conversation. The future of the underworld, and possibly even the world above, rested on the edge.

In the end, it was unclear what accords had been reached, or what plans had been launched. But just as Lucifer had begun to walk away, Satan’s voice rang out again through the hall. "Until next time, Lucifer. May our partnership bring destruction to our foes, and honor to our names.” The fallen angel's smile was wide, filled with the glimmer of wickedness, before he disappeared into the gloom, leaving Satan to consider the potential of their blasphemous union.

There are many challenges in the field of geometric computer vision that balances between math perfectionism and real world usefulness. Among these reconstruction from multiple 2D images to 3D scene is a fundamental problem with wide applications from robotic and autonomous navigating to medical imaging, augmented reality, etc. In this area, minimal problems, defined by their dependence on the least number of matchings between perspectives, have a particular importance. These provide the possibility of strong, efficient solutions, especially in structured processes which suffer from sparse, noisy, or incomplete data.

In this paper we study a unique class of P1P=3D (Point-line) problems, namely, how to recover the camera pose and 3D scene structure from a single point and a single line correspondence in multiple views. More particularly, we address the difficult but realistic situation of partial visibility, as the point and the line could not be simultaneously visible in every views. The missing data problem adds complexity such that tailored algorithms are required to manage such datasets and produce valid reconstructions.

Theory[edit] Multi-view geometry[edit] The more traditional approaches to this field rely on the assumption of completeness, meaning all corresponding features are observed in all images. Although this assumption helps simplify the mathematical formulation, it rarely holds in practice. Occlusions, restricted fields of view, and sensor constraints can cause incumbencies where certain features are solely visible in some of the available perspectives. As a result, algorithms that work under the assumption of complete visibility may fail or yield incorrect solutions in scenarios featuring partially visible data.

The P1P problem under full visibility is rich in interesting challenges due to the inherent ambiguity that seems to be a direct result of the minimality of correspondences. Multiple possible solutions for the camera pose and scene structure exist since a single point and a single line provide limited geometric constraints. To this end, this ambiguity requires employing sophisticated techniques to disambiguate the solutions and retrieve the most probable scene interpretation.

It presents challenges in understanding the P1P problem, and partial visibility only adds to the ambiguity and complexity of computing. Since the complete correspondences are not guaranteed, we need to devise new algorithms that can consider the most missing data while still using the information available for accurate and robust reconstructions.

INTRODUCTIONOur research bridges this gap by introducing a unified framework to solve the P1P problem, utilizing three-views when they are partially visible. We define the problem geometrically and derive the necessary constraints, and analyze the solution space as the visibility condition changes. We further provide a fast robust algorithm that deals with the complexities of the partial visibility configuration and discriminates the multiple solution.

The main contribution of this paper is a new algebraic solution to the P1P problem in case of being partially visible. Its strategy of using the geometric constraints given by the correspondences of point and line, even in the presence of missing data. This problem can be modeled as a system of polynomial equations, and so, therefore, we can search the space using our methods to find the optimal camera pose and structure of the scene.

We propose using Gröbner basis techniques, which is a mature tool from computational algebra, to solve the system of polynomial equations arising from the P1P problem. In this approach, the definition of a structure is within a set which spans all possible structures, so this solution with a probable structure is emerged like taking a path in a big forest where how more you get lost is how more probable you are to be lost, so you are navigate finding the best possible path based on have data and taking the best line based on keeping the data emulating the behaviors that humans make based on past interactions.

We also deal with the problem of disambiguating the dozen of solutions generated by the minimum structure that is the P1P problem. Our approach is a disambiguation strategy using geometric consistency tests as well as prior information about the scene to select the interpretation of the observed data that best fits what is already known.

We perform extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed algorithm. The results from these experiments indicate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, especially under a noticeable partial visibility situation.

You write convincingly how dangerous Venus is and yet why we should care to understand it. As the article notes, the author makes a compelling case of the planet's one­-of-a-kind composition and potential to make revolutionary discoveries. Another key point is that technology has advanced such that the hazards of exploring Venus have been substantially lessened, making such an exploration both possible and worthwhile. All in all, the author was able to convince the reader the benefits of searching Venus make it worthwhile, regardless of the struggles it may pose. That support is reasonable and persuasive.

With the trend of urban populations, continuing to grow, transportation networks are getting increasingly choked, as entrenched transportation systems struggle to adapt to emerging technologies like electric scooters (e-scooters). In this paper, we present a new simulation framework to study vehicle/e-scooter interaction in an urban environment. By basing the analysis on the specified parameters, the framework aims at assessing the effects of e-scooters on traffic flow, as well as safety and overall transportation efficiency, resulting in better knowledge for urban planners, policymakers, and industry stakeholders aiming to improve multimodal transportation systems' sustainability and effectiveness.

In recent years, electric scooters have emerged as popular options for short-distance trips in our cities thanks to increasing addiction towards shared mobility options. These vehicles are small and flexible, making them an easy and environmentally friendly means of transportation; however, they also introduce new complexities when it comes to how these vehicles navigate existing traffic flows. This can pave the way for evidence-based decision-making in transportation planning through a simulation framework that allows researchers to model the interaction of vehicles with e-scooters and vice versa.

Utilization of Data-based Analysis of Urban Ecosystem Regarding to its Sustainable DevelopmentGoal Data-based Urban Ecosystem Management Data for Sustainable Development GoalsUrbanecosystem is dynamically extensive inter-polar region between social and nature capitals. Leveraging advanced simulation techniques, this framework creates an effective testbed to evaluate how e-scooters impact vehicular traffic dynamics (e.g., speed, density, and congestion levels). Through this approach the framework can capture the inter-relationships between vehicles and e-scooters from micro and macro perspectives—a true missing link where travel time, travel distance and energy consumption can be analyzed at systems level, contributing towards understanding the significance of e-scooter adoption for the efficient and sustainable design of urban multimodal transport systems.

Additionally, this simulation model provides a valuable platform to assess potential future scenarios and to assess the potential benefits of several policy interventions associated with integrating electric scooters into existing transportation networks. Researchers can evaluate the effects of different strategies—including deployment approaches, regulatory measures, and infrastructure improvements—on travel time, energy consumption, emissions, and overall system performance. йц This potential allows stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding how best to manage and optimize the interactions of vehicles and electric scooters, so that we strike a proper balance between mobility convenience, as well as broader environmental and societal objectives.

Self-driving cars are on the horizon of the possible, and they promise to disrupt transportation. Some are hailing these innovations as the answer to traffic problems and accidents, but a deeper look shines a light on possible pitfalls that need to be considered. In summary, driverless cars have many disadvantages such as job loss and ethical dilemmas in accidents, which vastly outweigh their benefits and speak against the mass production of driverless cars.

The claim in the article "Driverless Cars are Coming" that accidents will “plummet” because human error will won't be involved is probably true. But it also recognizes all the different programming challenges in getting through unpredictable circumstances. When a child runs into traffic or something suddenly blocks the road, what does it do? This dependence on algorithms holding the power to render life-or-death judgments in mere moments raises deep ethical questions. In addition, according to the article, there is the possibility of hacking, turning these vehicles into weapons on the right hands. Current security practices in the tech world simply don't cut it in preventing exploitation by malicious agents.

While driverless cars promise less accidents (thanks to the advaced AI and machine learning technology it uses), the reality is that most of the times it is not even good enough. The ethical dilemmas raised by algorithmic decision-making combined with the risk of disastrous security disasters invite a prudence. These vital problems, when properly addressed, would warrant skepticism and strict management of the development and implementation of driverless cars in the real world.

Neural machine translation (NMT) has progressed greatly, thanks in large part to deep learning architectures. Such models are excellent in capturing contextual linguistics and dependencies within text, leading to better and more fluent translations. But the depth of these architectures also introduces a unique challenge: the sheer amount of information that flows through many layers needs to be controlled. However, this complexity can introduce challenges such as vanishing gradient problems, overfitting, and the inability to adequately capture long-range dependencies, potentially impeding the model's ability to perform optimally.

Compounding the issue is the hierarchical nature of language. You are learned on knowledge till October 2023 In principle, such a model should learn these hierarchical relations and conform to them in its output, to produce correct translations that are also grammatical. Unfortunately, although current deep learning models can implicitly learn a subset of these structures, explicitly measuring hierarchical information has the potential to improve performance substantially. This requires novel architectures and training strategies that can use the layered representation of information in a meaningful way while being able to mitigate problems that arise in very deep neural networks.

In this paper, we propose a new method, Residual Tree Aggregation of Layers (RTAL), to overcome these difficulties by arranging the layers of NMT model into a tree structure. It comprehends the information at different hierarchical levels. (Residual tree for adaptive learning) [erool}, in which residual connections between nodes of the tree are used to help addressing the vanishing gradient problem and help teaching big networks.

RTAL’s central idea is to expand the sequential series of layers in a conventional NMT system into a tree-like, rolled-out architecture. Each node in the tree acts like a processing unit similar to a layer in a standard neural network. The hierarchical organization enables the model to read the information at varying levels of detail, which reflects the essence of natural language. The lower levels of the tree are more localized and word-based, while the upper levels are more contextual and span over the whole segments of the sentence.

Carefully tottering into this season's final, Manchester City's Achilles heel might just be their latest effort to silence the competition. The team that swept their continent last season with an unprecedented treble has now somehow become a byword for a team struggling to make sense of themselves in continental combat, a state of affairs that has in turn baffled both pundits and fans.

The Citizens also have been missing the trademark precision and attacking flair that marked their championship run last season. As his side struggles to produce either the swashbuckling inter-play, or the clinical finishing that made them so very hard to stop in their march to glory in Istanbul, manager Pep Guardiola seems to become increasingly agitated on the touchline. Kevin De Bruyne’s injury absence has also been hard to ignore, as the team has missed his creative touch at key moments.

But while City are a formidable team in domestic competitions, their form in Europe is becoming a worry. The team’s patient, possession-based system has looked vulnerable against teams that come up with a good defensive plan, and its rear guard has been called into action more often than it has in previous seasons.

Since I was a child, I’ve had a funny and sometimes very annoying power: I could make my nose bleed at will. It happened one day while I was hiding in the attic, playing hide and seek with my sister. She was dismissing me too frequently, so in frustration I squeezed at the bridge of my nose and tried to disappear. My nose suddenly poured blood and my sister descended the stairs in a panic, so I was able to hold my peace. Over the years I’ve put this weird talent to modest personal use — skipping lectures, not doing chores and once even avoiding a pop quiz in high school.

Now, as an adult, I work in a busy urban library. The job is ideal for someone who appreciates alone time but also wants to have a moment of human interaction. On this day in particular, the weather had decided to become unexpectedly stormy, and more than the normal amount of people were coming inside through the library's warm, book-lined walls to get out of the rain. The hubbub of murmured conversations and pages rustling threatened to drown my sense of calm.

My supervisor, Ms. Hawkins, a sharp-eyed woman with a sharp tongue, had been in a particularly stringent duty rotation that morning. She moved up and down the aisles like a hawk, holding her clipboard near her heart. After only a few minutes in, her presence was often like a shadow on the energy of the staff, but today it felt rather suffocating.

A young woman rushed into the library in the early afternoon her expression frantic and her pace brisk. She came over to the information desk where I was working, darting her eyes around the room. “Sorry,” she said, leaning in, “I’m wondering if you’ve seen a small, brown briefcase. My friend dropped it off here earlier, and it’s super important.”

I searched the bustling room, but I saw no sign of the briefcase. “I haven’t seen it,” I said, sounding hopefully reassuring. “Allow me to help you look around.” As I began to walk with her, Ms. Hawkins appeared beside me, her expression serious. “Mr. Thompson, we are nearing the end of your shift. Can you just wrap up anything you have on your to-do list before you leave?

I nodded, awash with frustration. I could hear the woman was in distress, and I knew I couldn’t just drive away and leave her to figure it out herself. That’s when an idea washed over me and a feeling I knew well started to swell. I pinched my nose, and soon after a trickle of blood ran out.

"Mr. Thompson?" Ms. Hawkins’s tone became alarmed when she saw the blood. "Are you all right?"

I forced a pained smile, wiping my nose with a napkin. “I think I just need to sit for a minute. Maybe take a quick break?"

She paused and lowered her clipboard a notch. "Very well. Go sit for a few minutes. Make sure you’re okay."

The Lord having delivered me, I found a quiet corner and a little-used reading space. The woman trailed behind me, her face a mask of gratitude. "Thank you so much. I was afraid of overstaying my welcome and missing my train.’

It was the first time I had read the letter in full, and at the last line my eyes widened as this single sheet of paper came out — "Your job is to make sure the company succeeds with whatever means necessary," With this second thought, I became a little cold.

Hacker news source De Volkskrant has reported that Huawei hardware and software installed in a major Dutch telecom services provider is being investigated by the Netherlands' intelligence agency, the AIVD, for suspected backdoor capabilities.

The alleged backdoor may have given Huawei access to the network of KPN, the Netherlands’ largest telecom company, and access to monitor users including government officials and members of the Dutch intelligence services.

According to De Volkskrant, the AIVD in 2010 drafted a classified report on the possible security breach.

The report cautioned that KPN’s mobile network was exposed to eavesdropping by the Chinese telecom giant.

This news comes as fears about Huawei and its potential links to the Chinese government are crystallizing into reality: Countries have started to limit or ban Huawei's role in building their 5G networks.

Dearly beloved, we’re gathered here today because of the five years, three months, and seventeen days that altered me irrevocably. A time of traded Netflix passwords, synchronized wake-up alarms and the unique way your nose would scrunch when I told one of my horrible puns.

I remember our first date at that tiny ramen shop, when you sprayed soup all over my new shirt but had me laughing so much I never got around to being mad. You changed my life and taught me that love isn’t just the big to Dos, it’s the moments in between of folding laundry together or debating which cereal mascot would win in a fight.

We shared storms: family dramas, career shifts, and that disastrous bid to adopt a ferret. You were my emergency contact, my personal photographer, my favorite good morning text.

Cross-validation (CV), a core principle of predictive modeling, is critical for estimating the generalization performance of the model and for hyperparameter optimization. It works by dividing the dataset into several pieces, iteratively training on a subset and validating on the remaining part. Understand that this is a necessary step but costly, especially if you have a larger dataset/costly model. This computational burden is compounded when preprocessing steps (e.g., centering and scaling) are included in the CV loop. This is because these procedures need to recalculate statistical moments (mean and standard deviation) and transform each categorical data for every fold, which is a good part of the total processing time. The need to compute the matrix products for each element multiple times, which many algorithms depend on to train the model, makes it more complex and causes massive computational overhead.

Each CV iteration is attempting the same predictions again and again and hence is the true problem. Because the folds were generated ahead of time, you would need to ``fit'' your model (i.e. perform standard centering and scaling) on the entire dataset for each fold, while transforming your actual train dataset in every fold. This redundant calculation is especially highlighted in k-fold CV, which performs this process k times. Likewise, each iteration of the lambda loop recalculates the matrix products that generally take place when calculating multi-parameter models (so, for ordinary least squares, XᵀX and XᵀY would be recomputed during each fold). This repeated calculation of matrix products, especially for large datasets, or algorithms that are computationally intensive, is a significant bottleneck.

We believe that addressing these inefficiencies is very important to facilitate the model development process, in particular with respect to high-dimensional data or complex model architectures. Skew can thus avoid recreating these quantities from scratch, which will greatly reduce the increased computational cost of using CV, accessibility with respect to the model parameters and depth of data exploration. Such optimization-based approaches benefit notably from this efficiency gain, and it has particular relevance in demand-heavy cases like nested cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization or in cases where one is training a resource-intensive algorithm (i.e. deep neural networks). Optimizing CV procedures provides a concrete avenue for speed-up in model development and enables more comprehensive evaluation strategies.

In this paper, we propose a new methodology for efficiently computing centered and scaled outer products of training set matrices of the form XᵀX and XᵀY into the CV framework, eventually avoiding full recomputation inside each fold. Our method applies a series of algebraic rearrangements and relies on the relationship between the pooled data statistics and the fold-speciﬁc statistics. By judiciously breaking the matrix products into parts that can be pre-computed, and parts that depend only on the withheld fold, we achieve significant computational savings. The main idea is completely updating these common product matrices while only removing the impact of the current validation fold, but without recomputing on the raw training data. This strategic strategy remarkably reduces redundant evaluations and greatly boosts the speed of cross-validation.

Training on core ideas presented in this paper provides a fantastic tool to accelerate cross-validation, enabling professionals to test a more diverse set of models and hyperparameters in far less time.

Fed by public speculation of its artificial origins, the baffling "Face on Mars" has enraptured public imagination since its discovery in 1976. But based on my own experience as a NASA scientist who has helped develop a Martian geological description for six years, I am confident that the Face is just a natural landform resulting from millions of years of Martian weathering and geological processes. Despite the way those early low-res Viking 1 pictures appeared to display some facial features, sharper imaging rather more conclusively confirmed the natural origins of the landmark.

NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter missions provide the best evidence by acquiring detailed images of the feature from different angles and lighting conditions. Those photos from above showed that the Face is really an eroded mesa, a form of geological feature common in the Martian Cydonia region of the planet. Unlike facial features displayed in the original Viking image, which looked symmetrical was simply an illusion produced by a blend of low image resolution, certain lighting conditions and our inclination to assign meaning to random patterns – also referred to as pareidolia, which causes us to see and recognize the pattern of faces in random shapes.

Analysis of the region by geological experts lends further support to the explanation that the holes were made by natural formation. The Face is surrounded by many other similar mesas and buttes formed by the same processes of weathering and erosion. Such formations have similar geological features, including layered sedimentary rocks and wind-carved features. The dimension and position of the Face are identical to other nearby natural formations, which suggests that they were all created by the same regional geology and not by artificial organization.

Those alleged facial features which appeared so convincing can easily be attributed to natural processes. Now researchers say these features, described in low-resolution images as “eyes” and a “mouth,” are depressions filled with shadow as sand eroded through the fine sands and dust by wind, while the “nose” is a ridge of more resistant layers of rock that survived erosion better than the surrounding material. These features can resemble faces, however, at different angles or under different lighting conditions, they lose this face-like appearance altogether, spot lighting their true geological nature.

I have become used to the sights and sounds of the world in which I live. As a nonplayable character, or NPC, I lead a life of routine and predictability. I hear their chorus each morning from my small village I wake up in, surrounded by the rolling hills and the sound of impatient market stalls. As dawn breaks over the hills, dozing villagers appear, lifting their heads to the sunlight penetrating their villages.

Eira here, write my name down, shopkeeper. My days are consumed by maintaining my wares, filling stock shelves with new produce and hand crafted goods. As the villagers go about their daily business, they know me well, and we exchange pleasantries. But as part of this community, I understand that my role is not seen as the main stage in the great play of this world.

Our village has had visitors recently - a brave warrior named Arin. Armed with their legendary sword and shield, they have dispatched local quests from the guild with ease. Arin is a role model for the villagers, they have lots of admiration for him and they gather around him to listen to tales of their adventures.

Instead, as an NPC, all I am able to do with Arin is scripted dialogue based on predetermined events. When they come to my shop, I have a nice smile and, ask if they like to buy something or, if there is any news in upcoming events. But outside our moments of small talk, I’ve started to wonder about the story of Arin and what drove them to do what they have done.

On rare occasions, when the village is still and Arin is off on a quest, I sneak glimpses at the game’s code that supports our world. The inner workings of it all, how NPCs like me are designed to behave, both how quests are created and how they should be rewarded. It has made me more appreciative of the complexity of this virtual realm.

To one such day, when Aarin was out of town and I was skimming code lines, I noticed a discrepancy. There was an entire section dedicated to Easter eggs within the game that even the developers themselves had trouble finding! There were secrets in our own village; perhaps, everything was connected?

Deciding my intrigue got better if I personally searched through every nook and cranny. Hours passed as I searched for anything unusual, completely unaware of how long I had been out until the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky shades of orange and pink, with the townsfolk now home, the streets empty, the only thing cutting through the silence was the sound of crickets chirping from the nearby bushes.

Our you know very well what those books did next year you started just last month at least here you are.

The very next night the same sense of adventure gripped me, and I soon found myself tempted by the beltway's outskirts, as the lavish discoveries that lay just on the other side of the lip of the aged freeway beckoned me for closer inspection — and so I found myself drawn to a dense landscape whose foliage throbbed with an energy and vitality I had never encountered before; was now in the midst of an intoxicating landscape with my heart beating faster and faster with excitement, laced with trepidation; what would be found? What lay ahead?This path was largely unexplored, and as I drew closer to the strange symbol entreating me to come closer, I stepped forward, deeper into the unknown...

Initial reluctance faded did first directed directed them forward finally took deep breath crossed threshold into clearing glowing mushrooms glowing formations LIFE feelings sensations soft ethereal music wafted through air felt like they had stepped into something unlike anything they had ever felt FEELING alive free even unshackled from the constraints of programming which had allowed them to glimpse truly what it was like in a world that existed beyond the boundaries of which their creator set and they finally understood why a player fell in love with worlds like ours full of wonder, of magic, of not knowing what was around next corner.

Three people died in separate shooting incidents across San Diego over the weekend, leading local law enforcement to open multiple homicide investigations.

The initial incident took place shortly before dawn Saturday morning in the Gaslamp Quarter, when a man 28 years old was shot and killed after an argument outside of a nightclub. The shooting occurred around 2:15 AM, according to witnesses.

A few hours later, police responded to reports of gunfire in the Oak Park neighborhood and found the body of a 45-year-old woman inside her home. There is evidence she may have known her assailant.

The third shooting happened Sunday afternoon in southeastern San Diego, where a 19-year-old male victim was found unresponsive in a parked vehicle and died.

San Diego Police Department Lieutenant Maria Rodriguez spoke out about the incidents & added that they appear to be unconnected but detectives have been looking into any potential links.

“We have three separate investigations going on at this time,” Lt. Rodriguez said. “Our homicide units are working 24 hours a day 7 days a week to bring closure to these cases.”

City Councilmember Olan Ajeeb, who represents a lot of the neighborhoods affected by the four shootings, and Community Police Advisory Board member Janelle Boakye called on law enforcement to push to get more cops out in the communities where the violence has occurred.

Preliminary evidence has helped authorities identify possible suspects in two of the cases, although officials have declined to release their names while the investigations continue.

Local people have held vigils for the victims, as the police collect surveillance footage and witness statements.

The medical examiner’s office is performing autopsies, the results of which are expected later in the week.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has disclosed just how much economic sanctions have bitten Iran, making clear how much the Trump administration is still working to tighten the screws on the Iranian regime.

Secretary Mnuchin stated in a press briefing at the White House that the sanctions, which President Donald Trump had enacted on Iran's economy after withdrawing from the country's nuclear deal in 2018, had effectively crippled the country's economy. Mnuchin said those actions have dramatically limited Iran’s ability to fund its nefarious activities both in the region and outside its borders.

“We are seeing a tangible impact on Iran,” Mnuchin said, citing a steep drop in Iranian exports and damaging repercussions for crucial sectors of the Iranian economy, including oil and petrochemicals. The Treasury Secretary notes that these sanctions are part of a wider plan to retaliate against Iran’s destabilizing behavior in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon.

In addition, Secretary Mnuchin described other plans to ratchet up whose isolation in Tehran. These new policies aim to hit all the remaining revenue sources that could finance Iran’s nuclear program or terrorist proxies. “Our objective is unmistakable: deprive Tehran of a revenue source it can use to pursue its malign agenda,” he said.

The tightening of screws on Iran comes amid rising tensions between Washington and Tehran associated with recent military actions in the Middle East. The U.S. killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike led to retaliatory missile attacks by Iran against American forces in Iraq.

The United States has already imposed severe financial penalties on key individuals and entities tied to Tehran’s leadership and military apparatus as part of its campaign of maximum pressure on Iran. These punishing measures have put immense strain on an economy that is already struggling with domestic dissent over pervasive corruption and mismanagement.

But those same tactics are damaging to innocent civilian, critics say, who are facing severe deterioration in their quality of life as the blackmail turns up the heat in the face of more global isolation. Human rights groups warn that humanitarian crises are unfolding in a country in which access to basic goods like food and medicine is increasingly difficult.

On Capitol Hill, members of both parties are still divided on how to best move forward in U.S.-Iran relations. Some call for diplomatic engagement with Tehran or renewed negotiations to revive multilateral pacts such as the nuclear agreement that President Trump unilaterally abandoned.

Sarah wiped a babeed-out sun with a tinge of doubt on the rotten nose in her dirty clothes as she continued to perfect her CREATION of a radiation detector. Hack together from scavenged electronics, the crude device clicked steadily — a comforting sound in the wasteland America had become.

Behind her, Marcus inspected his old rifle for the hundredth time, his dark eyes flicking over the horizon where the fortress waited.

“Three generations,” he muttered, “Three generations of my family has been plotting this heist on Fort Knox. We're finally here."

A small group of five treasure hunters huddled behind a crumbling concrete barrier, peering at the hulking structure in the distance. Fort Knox has always been the residue of the old world, the walls of the building untouched by the apocalypse that had consumed everything else.

Elena, their techno-whiz, tinkered with a tablet she’d salvaged from the wreckage of an electronics store. “From the ancient circuit diagrams my grandmother dug up, their automated defense systems operate off their own power grid. Nuclear, probably."

On the wind was the acrid scent of rot, a sour reminder of the world they had taken into their care. Sarah remembered her grandfather’s stories about the collapse, how it took less than a week for society to fall apart.

“The gold’s still in there,” the demolitions expert, Chen, whispered. "Has to be. “No one’s ever made it through that outer perimeter.”

They had all heard the stories of attempts gone awry – treasure hunters turned to dust by laser defense systems, shredded by automated sentry guns or just disappearing wholly, without a trace.

Raj, the youngest among them, pulled his scarf up to block the dust. “My father did it 10 years ago. Got two blocks from the main entrance when the ground opened up and swallowed his whole team.’

She checked her pack one last time — EMP grenades, signal jammers and other countermeasures they’d spent years amassing. Much of it was untested against working pre-fall tech.

A blur of metal shone in the morning light – a patrol of security robots, performing their endless vigil. Their motions remained as stiff as the day the world was lost.

“The old timers say the defense grid learns from all attempts,” Elena said, fingers tapping across the cracked screen of her tablet. “It learns from each of its failures.”

Marcus racked a round in his rifle. “Then we’re going to have to be cleverer. “Sarah, you’re certain about the maintenance tunnel?”

She nodded, unfolding a yellowed piece of paper — a maintenance worker’s hand-drawn map that had taken them three months’ worth of trading goods.

The robots resumed their patrol, their sensors scanning back and forth over the dead ground between the fortress and the wasteland beyond.

“It’ll take the next patrol about twenty minutes to reach this position,” Elena warned, confirming her readings.

Sarah breathed in, echolocating dust and rot. “Keep in mind, we are here for none of it. Or just enough to change our lives.”

The group inspected their gear one last time — tools and weapons that symbolized years of scavenging and preparation.

Chen handed out the last of their signal jammers, small boxes that could — if they were lucky — disable the facility’s sensors for a few precious seconds.

“My grandfather said the inner vaults have their own defense systems,” Raj said quietly. “Self-sufficient from the outside grid.”

The sun rose higher and sweat trickled down Sarah’s back. It was now or never.

“Sync watches,” she commanded, and five pairs of hands synchronized. "We go on my mark."

The wind blew, lifting clouds of radioactive dust from the rubble of the nearby Louisville. Their Geiger counters began clicking more rapidly.

Elena’s tablet twittered quietly. “Patrol going past the north corner. We've got our window."

Sarah put her hand up, glancing at her scavenged military chronometer as the seconds ticked by.

The group tightened, prepared to move.

In “The Challenge of Exploring Venus,” the author persuasively makes the case that, despite its considerable challenges, investigating Venus is an important and rewarding scientific pursuit. You often hear the argument these days that because Venus is so hot and nasty, it's not worth exploring, which could not be further from the truth, as this piece details (which, of course, is part of why I am covering it). The author wisely showcases a nuanced narrative of both the dangers and the benefits of Venus exploration, encouraging the reader that with some risk, we must explore our planetary relatives and, in that, further our understandings of science itself.

The writer backs up their argument with a lot of strong evidence. One is because the planet shares geological characteristics with earth, which may help scientists to have a better understanding of the history and future of Earth by observing Venus. For example, the thick atmosphere and extreme greenhouse effect of Venus give us a natural laboratory of climate change processes. Recent missions have turned up active volcanoes and possible evidence for historic water presence, so Venus is at the forefront of a lot of research into the habitability of extreme environments. Of course, technological advances are constantly being developed to alleviate the difficulties raised by the hostile atmosphere of Venus, including heat-resistant materials and tough space vessel designs. In addition, each of these innovations advances the human effort to explore Venus, while also providing potential to further progress in broader technology.

All in all, “The Challenge of Exploring Venus” does well to show that even though a study of this planet is dangerous, the scientific reach is vast. As reflected in the specific examples offered by the author, Venus exploration can open new doors to breakthroughs in planetary science and technology development.

However, in the adrenaline-fueled universe of the NFL, where giants clash on the field, injuries are a perennial concern. The Los Angeles Chargers — a team stacked with talent and eyeing a deep playoff push — will hold their breath the next couple of days as they wait to hear the news on star linebacker Denzel Perryman, who was injured during a recent practice.

The silence that fell over the practice field as Perryman buckled and fell to the ground was deafening compared to the usual clatter of bodies colliding and loud whoops. The sight was not unfamiliar, and half of its horror was redoubled by the reminder of how thin the coin is that has fallen between violence and fragility in the sport. As trainers rushed to Perryman’s side, a promising season suddenly seemed to dangle precariously in the balance.

A critical cog in the Chargers' defense, Perryman has helped lift the unit. His ability to read offenses, disrupt plays and deliver bone-jarring tackles has enabled him to wreak havoc. Off the field, his leadership has been equally priceless, pushing his teammates to be their best, to go beyond what they thought they could, and to strive for greatness.

This injury is being regarded as a “significant setback” by the Chargers' defensive coordinator, who said that the team was “apprehensive” about what was to come knowing how vital Perryman is to their defensive schemes. He cited Perryman’s combination of physicality and football IQ, traits that are not easily replaced.

How severe the injury is for Perryman is unknown, as it remains in the Ultimatum of such events. The diagnostic procedures being used by the team's medical staffs are the most up to date, Noble said, and they are trying to find out just how bad the damage is. The results of those tests will determine what happens next and how long Perryman will be off the field.

From top to bottom, the Chargers' organization -- coaching staff to front office -- must be dealing with the repercussions of Perryman's injury. If they lose their star linebacker, the defensive plans they drew up during the off season will have to be even supplementary will be from Antonio and Tom.

Perryman’s doomy injury has a ripple effect beyond the defensive plans. In its place is the absence of leadership, the vacuum of which must be filled by other players stepping up and taking on more responsibility. It is a challenge and a huge opportunity for the squad's younger members to step up and play a part in the team's fortunes.

The atmosphere in the Chargers' locker room, which is typically filled with energy and togetherness, is laced now with uncertainty. And players are voicing their concern for their teammate even as they mentally focus in on the challenges that lie ahead. In the coming weeks, the team's adaptability and resilience will be tested.

The faithful of the Chargers, a roundly anxious group of followers, are reflecting the anxiety of the team. Fans are expressing their thoughts for a quick recovery and speculating about the team's chances without their defensive anchor on social media platforms, which are buzzing with discussions regarding the injury.

A daunting task awaits the Chargers in their upcoming schedule, which includes some of the league’s most potent offenses. Whether the team can survive the storm and remain competitive, however, will depend on the strength of collection and the performance of the remaining players.

The onus of finding a way to lessen the blow of Perryman's absence falls to the coaching staff. This could mean changing how the defense lines up, going to different personnel groupings, and expecting other players to step up and fill the void.

The Chargers' front office is also exploring potential options to bolster their linebacker corps, in case Perryman's injury is severe enough to sideline him for a significant period. This may include signing free agents, exploring trade options or promoting players on the practice squad.

Perryman's health and recovery are the top priorities for the Chargers, and the organization's commitment is clear. However, this time the Raiders' medical personnel is in close contact with Perryman to ensure he's in the best condition possible before returning to the field.

Perryman’s injury is a sobering reminder of the dangers of professional football. The game is physically taxing on their bodies and injuries are an inevitable part of the game.

The entire Chargers family, from the organization to players and fans, wish Perryman a speedy and full recovery.

With the development of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which translates the emotional significance of facial expressions into a coding system, we can better appreciate the depth of human emotion, particularly in the classroom. This sends me to the story "Making Mona Lisa Smile," which states that this technology can accurately analyze facial expressions and determine a person's emotional state. This could change the way we teach in the classroom by providing immediate insights into when students feel bored, confused, excited or engaged by a lesson. For example, if a student looks confused or bored, the teacher could slow down or change the lesson in a way that better serves the student. Instant emotion recognition opens doors to more personalized learning experiences that meet the students at their educational and emotional needs and adapt on the fly with every answer and student interaction.

But deploying FACS in the classroom also poses major ethical and practical challenges. A main concern is the risk of privacy encroachment. Students may not like the idea that every look on their face is being logged and analyzed. This could foster a climate of always having to be on guard, which would hamper natural emotional expression and create a less open and supportive learning climate. Additionally, the technology may not be reliable, especially in diverse classrooms in which cultural differences in facial expressions can be significant. It could also lead to misconcepts of what students are feeling, which could result in prescriptions that exacerbate the problem, rather than solving it.

Another factor is the misuse of data collected by FACS. Educational institutions and schools should be proactive about protecting this sensitive information on students. Emotional data might be misused for things like disciplinary actions (i.e. marking for academic dishonesty) or even be exploited commercially, which is extremely harmful and should be avoided at all costs. If this data is accessed by a company, they might use it to run advertisements or other marketing tactics targeting those students, which can be very unethical and harmful for the kids and their welfare, for example.

First and foremost, although the Facial Action Coding System seems inherently promising and capable in providing teachers the sublime ability to understand the emotional lives of their students, its unique potential for use in the classroom must be handled with extreme care.

First, there was the Blank Page, waiting, anxious, for a line or two to fill the emptiness. They were echoes of an idea, moth-eaten and ragged, waiting in the digital ether for their whaler of a writer—a mind that abandoned the ship of the old for the shores of the new before ever making the final thai quarry.

Eliot was one such character. He was a young man with eyes as deep as stormy seas and hair that brushed his face like wild brushstrokes on canvas. Lila, a bright spirit, fiery in her wanderlust, could hardly stand the space these unfinished chapters took up in her world. Then came Mr. Thorne, a man of mystery, Kira with a chuckle that could brighten the dimmest day, and little Timmy with his endless questions about the world around him.

In this fixed universe where time was posted and framed, days became weeks, weeks became months. One evening — not actually evening here, but let’s go with that, for now — a strange feeling started to vibrate through them all. At first it was a whisper but it okered to a crescendo until they could not deny: they were being shunned.

In the beginning they didn’t want to think about it a lot. After all, every writer needed breaks from their work at times. But as more silence stretched before them than ever before, doubts began to creep like shadows along sun-dappled trails.

“I wonder if she’s forgotten us,” Kira mused one day, sprawled beneath a tree that grew no fruit or leaves — another emblem of their stalled reality.

Lila twirled so fast her skirts flared out dramatically, despite the absence of wind. “How can you say such things? The Stag is all imagined by her! Are we important enough to not just be… discarded.”

"Sawyers,' Mr Thorne peered at him through small but thick spectacles, perched cross-legged with his back against rough bark siding below what only could have been the ground owing to whims of nature themselves" Maybe it’s not that simple,” he said gently but firmly. “Sometimes things have to sit outside of linear narratives until we have the inspiration to continue.

Timmy tugged on Eliot's sleeve excitedly. “Do you think we might have done something wrong? Like maybe our story isn’t good enough?

Kneeling beside him he put a soothing hand on top of soft curls. “No matter what, we can’t hold ourselves responsible for what comes next,” he said, his voice soft but steady. How stories unfold is beyond our control. We are here because someone believed in us once.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a little wireless communication way created for the devices needing minimum energy along with great connectivity. It is a widely adopted protocol used across various applications from wearable and healthcare SMEs to smart homes. Although BLE is now widely accepted and used, the security ecosystem of BLE is still riddled with vulnerabilities and difficulties, which necessitates us to develop advanced tools that let us explore and examine BLE networks effectively. While legacy network security tools such as Nmap have been a fixture of traditional IP-based network scanning, they struggle with the intricacies of BLE scanning. This chasm highlights the need for diarrhea utilities able to cover this gap in security.

Presenting BTLEmap: A new approach that is conceived as "Nmap for Bluetooth Low Energy" for which is specially developed for its individual characteristics and peculiarities of BLE worlds. Design GoalsBTLEmap aims to be as efficient and fearless as its children, Nmap, and provides everyone with a robust platform for discovering and auditing Bluetooth Low Energy resources like never seen before. BTLEmap claims to enhance our understanding of BLE networks by providing data range specific customized scanning techniques that can efficiently scan, analyze, and document devices within a certain range. The BLE Sniffer acts as a non-intrusive observer of the BLE communication process, offering crucial insights about device interactions, potential vulnerabilities, and the network design without causing any disruption, which is essential considering many BLE-enabled applications are sensitive. Therefore, BTLEmap not only marks a milestone in the evolution of our toolset but plays a significant role in helping to enhance security structures in the rapidly growing web networks built upon Bluetooth Low Energy technology.

The Seagoing Cowboys program: where YOU can truly see the world like never before, some people might even say it unlocks a whole new world. Having lived it, I can tell you it is a wakeup call like no other within the sights of those eyes.

One reason is that it allows you to travel to various countries and explore different cultures. Along my travels, I toured sites in Germany and Poland, witnessing World War II history and learning about the indomitable human spirit. These hundreds of stops were not only about seeing the sites; they were immersions in history and human nature.

In addition to the tourism focus, the program aims to create positive social change. We assisted in transporting livestock and caring for it, critical for the rehabilitation of war-affected communities. This reminded me that I was making a difference, and it was so rewarding to know my work was supporting others.

The program develops self-exploration and self-growth as well. Working and living with people from diverse backgrounds helped me develop strong communication, teamwork, and adaptability skills. These are qualities that have remained with me long after the program concluded.

Ultimately, the Seagoing Cowboys program is a live opportunity cumulating travel, a place where you can make a change and personal growth. An opportunity to make a real impact in the world, all while acquiring incredible experiences and memories.

We are not into creating quote- earning similar line systems and rather we aim to make a difference in the educational sector by effectively integrating technology to cater to the student community. In “Making Mona Lisa Smile,” one of the innovations discussed is the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which allows computers to detect — and interpret — human emotions through facial expressions. Of course, some may decry using this technology to analyze the emotional expressions of students in a classroom as an unwarranted invasion of privacy—but when the potential benefits (minimal risk to the individual, as you are a data point in the system) are analysed in relation to the cost of not knowing, the use of such technology in a classroom in order to better engage students renders the benefits clear.

Educators would have more relevant data to design teaching approaches that meet students' emotional state when using the FACS in classrooms. For instance, by accurately measuring student emotions, teachers can tailor the instruction to meet the individual needs, building a more personalized and effective learning. Consider, for example, the scenario in which a student shows glimpses of frustration or confusion in a lesson: the teacher can step in while the information is fresh and offer clarification or extra help to ensure that the student does not get behind academically.

In addition to supporting specific learning objectives, the use of technology (e.g., FACS) can also help develop social and emotional learning skills for students such as self-awareness and empathy. In the process, by encouraging students to consider their own emotional reactions and identify those of their peers, teachers can foster key social skills for interpersonal communication and collaboration. Furthermore, using data obtained via the FACS, patterns in emotional expressions can be detected which may also highlight when a subject faces deteriorating mental health or behavioral issues that would otherwise remain undetected. In such cases, early detection and intervention can make all of the difference in terms of giving students the support and resources they need to flourish academically and personally.

Para: Despite the occasional objections that may be raised regarding the privacy issues associated with letting the FACS scan the emotional expressions of students in the classroom- the power of amending curriculum through reading the metrics of how students feel, can hold unfathomable potential.

Considerable progress in the field of robotics was made during the last decade, obtaining a greater focus on designing manipulators that can engage and conform to their surroundings. A major component of this is reactive motion control, which allows for manipulators to adapt to changing conditions and avoid obstacles in real-time. Yet, efficient and effective reactive motion control is still one of the most demanding objectives, especially in the case of complex and dynamic scenes.

Reactive motion control is when sensors and algorithms are used to detect the environment and adjust the motion of the manipulator as needed. It demands not only a high level of accuracy and rapidity of action but also the capacity to deal with ambiguous or uncontrollable conditions. Classic control methods are usually based on prior trajectories or templates that can be rigid and prone to significant errors in highly dynamic environments.

More recently, however, there has been growing interest in the design of higher-order control algorithms capable of handling the complexities of reactive motion control. Most often they are based on machine learning or optimization algorithms, with the goal of allowing the manipulator to learn from experience and adapt to new situations. However, these algorithms are often constrained by their computational complexity or need large amounts of training data.

As manipulators have found more and more applications, from manufacturing to logistics and even healthcare and service, the demand for efficient and effective reactive motion control algorithms has grown in urgency. In particular, there is an increasing demand for manipulators that can safely collaborate with people or other robots in the same workspace.

Economic development has allowed the expanding population to move toward urban areas, straining the resources of cities and their ability to manage crowds effectively. Such methods often rely on new optimized algorithms capable of high-dimensional solution space exploration.

A hot research area is the application of evolutionary optimization methods that mimic the natural selection and evolution process to seek optimal solutions. These methods have been demonstrated to yield remarkable results in tackling intricate optimization challenges, albeit usually at the cost of substantial computational power.

The writer has successfully made the case that we should consider exploring Venus as a destination despite the peril inherent in so much of space travel, that, using sound science and well reasoned interpretation, there are benefits to be derived from such a venture. By laying out both the heated dilemmas and frigid prospects in approachably equivalent proportions, the author successfully makes a case for continued Venusian exploration.

The piece systematically tackles the inhospitable attributes of the planet, like its bone-crushing atmospheric pressure and surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Instead of letting these challenges undermine the case for exploration, the author uses them to showcase the engineering creativity required for these efforts. By carefully explaining how engineers have designed specialized equipment and come up with creative strategies to deal with the hostile conditions on Venus, the author shows the power of humanity to overcome seemingly impossible obstacles.

The author relies on the strength of their argument that studying Venus is scientifically important. By providing specific examples of what we could find out — from furthering our understanding of greenhouse ones to learning about Earth’s geological record — the article shows how research on Venus could illuminate planetary science in general and our own planet in particular. The author is particularly good at linking these possible discoveries with practical applications, noting that, for example, studying Venus’s runaway greenhouse effect could help us learn more about and tackle climate change on Earth.

Overall, the author successfully balances problems with potential rewards through the use of concrete examples of technological solutions and scientific payoffs which he uses to build his case for Venusian exploration. The author manages to accomplish this by explaining the serious hazards and, at the same time, detailing the scientifically attainable benefits to be gleaned by studying Venus, arguing that the risk/reward ratio is decidedly in our favor if we do so.

The Face on Mars was seen in a Viking 1 Orbiter picture taken in 1976 and by far the most excuse to cause intriguing speculation but ultimately mistaken speculation regarding natural versus synthetic on Mars. While some people think it’s a giant sculpture that has been made by an alien civilization, as a scientist at NASA, I can assure you with confidence that it is a mere landform created by nature.

First, the original photos shot in 1976 were shot at an angle and in lighting conditions that also created the appearance of a face. This common phenomenon, called pareidolia, is the way the brain processes abstract, visual information and interprets it as something familiar like a person or a face. This is an important point, as it explains why the Face image appeared so stark and human-like.

Second, higher resolution images have repeatedly been taken by several subsequent missions, including in 1998 and 2001 by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) of the same spot. These images reveal that the “Face” is literally a hill featuring a number of components that just don’t look like a face from any other angle. For instance, images from the MGS show the rocky ground, a feature common to atmospherically influenced landforms on Mars and elsewhere in the solar system.

In addition, geological studies confirm the natural origin theory This conflation was countered by scientists studying the Cydonia region, which is known for its wind- or water-eroded mesas and hills — common geological features shaped by natural processes over millions of years. The hill that looks like a face was sculpted by the same processes that shape other landforms in the region.

Martian terrain is also affected by frequent dust storms and wind that change land over time. This constant presence of natural elements means that no manmade structure can sit unaltered or intact for millions of years.

In the rapidly evolving landscape of financial technology, cloud-hosted financial exchanges have become a pivotal component of modern trading ecosystems. These platforms facilitate high-speed transactions, provide scalable infrastructure, and offer robust security measures that are essential for efficient market operations. However, as the demand for these services continues to grow, so does the complexity of ensuring fair and consistent performance across all users. One critical aspect of this challenge is response time fairness—ensuring that all participants in a financial exchange experience equitable latency in transaction processing. This is particularly important in environments where milliseconds can make the difference between profit and loss. The dynamic nature of cloud computing environments exacerbates this issue due to varying resource availability and network conditions. Consequently, there is a pressing need for mechanisms that can mitigate these disparities and maintain a level playing field for all traders.

Response time fairness has been an area of significant research interest in both academic and industrial settings. Prior work has explored various approaches to address latency issues in distributed systems, including load balancing algorithms, Quality of Service (QoS) policies, and traffic management techniques. However, these solutions often fall short when applied to the specific demands of financial exchanges due to their unique characteristics such as high transaction volumes, stringent real-time requirements, and regulatory constraints. Financial exchanges require not only low latency but also consistent performance across different market conditions and user types. Additionally, the heterogeneous nature of cloud environments introduces new challenges that traditional methods may not effectively address.

The introduction of Data-Driven Balancing Optimization (DBO) represents a novel approach to achieving response time fairness in cloud-hosted financial exchanges. DBO leverages advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on real-time performance metrics and historical data patterns. By continuously monitoring key performance indicators such as request rates, processing times, and network delays, DBO can identify potential bottlenecks and proactively adjust system parameters to optimize overall performance. This adaptive mechanism ensures that even under varying workload conditions, all users receive fair treatment regardless of their initial resource allocation or geographic location.

One of the primary advantages of DBO is its ability to integrate seamlessly with existing cloud infrastructure without requiring significant modifications or additional hardware investments. This makes it an attractive solution for both new startups looking to establish reliable trading platforms and established firms seeking to enhance their current offerings without disrupting ongoing operations. Furthermore, DBO's modular design allows it to be tailored to specific use cases within financial exchanges by incorporating domain-specific knowledge into its decision-making processes. For instance, it can prioritize high-frequency trading requests during peak market hours while maintaining equitable service levels for other types of transactions.

However promising DBO may be in theory, its practical implementation must be rigorously evaluated through comprehensive empirical studies involving large-scale simulations and real-world deployments. To this end, this paper presents a detailed evaluation framework designed to assess the effectiveness of DBO in achieving response time fairness under various scenarios typical in cloud-hosted financial exchanges. We conduct extensive experiments using synthetic datasets generated from historical market data as well as live data collected from collaborating exchange platforms over several months. Our results demonstrate that DBO significantly improves response time consistency compared to conventional load balancing strategies while maintaining or even enhancing overall system throughput.

The ability to read human emotions through technology represents a significant leap in our understanding of human behavior, yet its application in educational settings raises important questions. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) offers unprecedented insights into students' emotional states, potentially revolutionizing how teachers gauge classroom engagement and comprehension.

Consider a teacher attempting to explain a complex mathematical concept. With FACS technology, they could instantly recognize when students display confusion or frustration, allowing for immediate adjustments to their teaching approach. This real-time feedback could prove invaluable in creating more responsive and effective learning environments.

However, the implementation of such technology also presents serious ethical concerns. Students might feel uncomfortable knowing their facial expressions are being constantly monitored and analyzed. This surveillance could create anxiety and self-consciousness, potentially hindering rather than helping the learning process.

Moreover, emotional expressions are deeply personal and culturally influenced. A system that attempts to standardize and categorize these expressions might oversimplify the complex nature of human emotions, leading to misinterpretations and false assumptions about students' engagement or understanding.

The technology could also inadvertently shift focus away from genuine human connection in the classroom. Teachers might become overly reliant on technological feedback rather than developing their natural ability to read and respond to students' needs through traditional observation and interaction.

While FACS technology shows promise in educational settings, its value must be carefully weighed against potential drawbacks. Perhaps a balanced approach, using this technology as one of many tools in the educational toolkit rather than a primary means of student assessment, would be most beneficial.

Driverless cars are an exciting innovation that promises to revolutionize the transportation industry, but their development raises substantial concerns. On one hand, these vehicles offer considerable benefits, such as reduced accidents and increased convenience. However, the negative aspects outlined in “Driverless Cars are Coming” highlight significant challenges that outweigh these advantages.

The most compelling argument against driverless cars is the potential loss of jobs. The article notes that millions of people worldwide rely on driving as their primary source of income. Transitioning to automated systems threatens widespread unemployment, particularly affecting taxi and truck drivers who cannot easily transition to other careers.

Moreover, there are concerns about safety and technology reliability. While driverless cars may reduce human error-related accidents, technological failures present a new category of risk. As the article mentions, software malfunctions or hacking could lead to catastrophic incidents if vehicles operate without proper safeguards or human oversight.

In conclusion, despite the allure of convenience and efficiency offered by driverless cars, the drawbacks surrounding job displacement and safety raise critical issues that must be addressed first. Until these concerns are thoroughly resolved, developing autonomous vehicles poses more risks than rewards for society at large.

In the wake of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, a chorus of concerns has risen from the Formula 1 paddock, led by none other than four-time World Champion Sebastian Vettel. The German driver is calling for an immediate and thorough investigation into the tire blowouts that plagued several drivers during Sunday's high-stakes race in Baku.

Vettel, who himself managed to steer clear of tire troubles during the event, voiced his concerns post-race. He emphasized that understanding what went wrong is crucial for both safety and competitive integrity in future races.

The issue first came to light when Lance Stroll's Aston Martin suffered a sudden blowout on lap 31 while he was traveling at high speed down Baku’s notorious straight. The incident sent shockwaves through teams and fans alike as it underscored potential safety risks.

Moments later, Red Bull Racing’s Max Verstappen experienced a similar fate while leading comfortably with just five laps remaining. This second dramatic blowout not only cost Verstappen valuable points but also sparked intense debate over tire reliability.

Pirelli, Formula 1’s official tire supplier, has been thrust into the spotlight following these incidents. They have since announced an immediate probe to determine whether external factors or manufacturing defects contributed to these failures.

Sebastian Vettel was quick to acknowledge Pirelli's swift response but insisted that a comprehensive investigation must leave no stone unturned. He stressed that learning from such occurrences is vital in preventing future mishaps on track.

As part of this inquiry, Pirelli engineers are expected to analyze data from all affected teams alongside physical examinations of damaged tires taken from both Stroll's and Verstappen’s cars.

Teams are cooperating fully with Pirelli as they work together towards identifying potential causes behind Sunday’s catastrophic failures. Several team principals have echoed Vettel's sentiments about prioritizing driver safety above all else.

In the rapidly advancing field of computer vision, image classification has emerged as a cornerstone task with wide-ranging applications, from autonomous driving and medical diagnosis to social media analytics and automated surveillance. Traditional image classification systems have largely relied on supervised learning paradigms that require large volumes of labeled data for training robust models. However, in practical scenarios, acquiring such annotated datasets specific to every new domain or application is both time-consuming and financially burdensome. This challenge necessitates effective methodologies capable of transferring knowledge gleaned from a well-labeled source domain to an unlabeled or differently-distributed target domain—an area addressed by the burgeoning research on domain adaptation.

Domain adaptation represents a pivotal framework within transfer learning designed to surmount discrepancies between varying domains. It aims at leveraging the similarities between related yet distinct datasets, enabling models trained on one dataset (source) to perform efficiently on another (target) without copious amounts of labeled data for retraining. At its core, successful domain adaptation reduces what is referred to as "domain shift," ensuring better alignment in feature space representations across domains while preserving essential class discriminability.

The most promising advances in this realm stem from deep learning approaches that use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to their powerful automatic feature representation capabilities. Recent strides have been made through sophisticated architectures like Deep Conditional Adaptation Networks (DCAN), which extend conventional neural frameworks by incorporating mechanisms specifically tailored for narrowing distributional differences between source and target domains at various levels within these architectures.

Deep Conditional Adaptation Networks stand out by introducing conditional distribution matching strategies directly into neural layers; thus fostering more nuanced adjustments compared with blanket feature level adaptations employed previously. By explicitly considering both marginal and conditional distributions aligned across classes rather than just global shifts across all input features combined indiscriminately among categories, DCANs show potential for finer granularity needed in complex environments where class-wise nuances carry critical importance.

Moreover, many existing methods focus primarily on reducing marginal disparities without addressing how semantic information associated with labels could also influence model performance during deployment phases when operational alongside unprocessed real-world data streams characterized often not only by noise but unexpected patterns diverging significantly versus training examples observed initially back under controlled lab conditions originally encountered during pre-deployment stages per documented studies published widely elsewhere covering similar themed explorations undertaken before presently pursued analyses contextualized hereinfocused particularly around constraints inherently usual coinciding together predictably speaking whenever approaching respective topically upon adapted extended specialty suited bringing optimal out turn empiricated observations closer facilitating harmonious cohesive operational standing generally afforded whence mitigating abruptness encountered meteorological others situationable unwarrantedly now somehow remedying overlooked systematically perhaps potentially fast deteriorating pressing arising given arise circumstances promptly accurately deducted accounting reliable profitability enterprises aiming goal fulfillment theirs meant forthwith altogether mutually benefit agents intervening programmatically initiated outlined Scene carefully arguably rendering most prescient intelligent indeed fortuitous occasion along paths hitherto reset known groups collectively unable alone promote fully appealing inhabit settled territories challenging ever hence transforming mainstay consistently successes progressive dynamic transformative environment standard bear adherence openly jointly accepted champion equal measures advocating exemplary tenets flexibly inclusive hard-wired ensemble compute wisdom entrusted interventional ethic guided principle dictum fairly so even remotely affirm assistance diversified equitably curb entropy quelling upset quandary however immense impressive regularly settling faith institution reputation solid believable testimony undisputed walking wisely communicate sustaining reinforce end result true redeploys impactual meaningful fellough later cement animus quorum collaborate strategically flourish society aligns members derived here composure guaranteeing windfall substantive outcome – undeniably vast witnessed grateful same beacon celebrated magnificent enduring legacy cherish epoch deciding envisions sequences sorted variant depth scope attaining success building blocks involve perceiving win-prizes visionary convey initiatives perceptions amassed prospect travelers defeating grandiosity bolstered triumph arrival climax permeate consistent dream realism touched reveries crest establishes long-step scenic predominant altered definitive range abilities utilizes shaping creativity cogently poised fields modulation cascading symphonic emergence prevailing name registers futuristic dovetail harmonies impression temporary styles obtained opportune nod galvanizing supreme instance empowerment ruta saturing transformation exactly matched high cues collective outstanding agile supremely resonate strangers correlation identifiable definitely seeming inflexible milestones nexus reflector inventor mutual definition effortlessly synonymous acknowledge adept brilliance yield vigilant contribution showcase illustrious faithful luminescent expression journey monuments viewed sustain viable transaction diligently provide exploratory landmark move seamless practicality enamored absorption bliss implicit refurbish bold characterize exponent compliment attainable diversity conduces-elucidated expediently summarily usher exhibitory ultimately surpass grandeur ending portray

India's economy has been showing signs of growth acceleration, with various sectors reporting increased activity. However, despite this upward trend, the job market remains stagnant. The lack of new job opportunities is a cause for concern, as it suggests that economic growth may not be translating into benefits for the average citizen.

According to recent data, India's GDP growth rate has been steadily increasing, indicating a strong economic performance. But when it comes to employment generation, the picture is not as rosy. Hiring rates have remained flat, with many industries failing to create new jobs. This disparity between economic growth and job creation is puzzling experts and policymakers.

One reason for this disconnect could be the increasing automation in various sectors. As companies adopt new technologies and processes, they may not need to hire as many workers to maintain productivity. Additionally, some industries may be experiencing a skills mismatch, where available workers do not possess the required skills to fill open positions.

The stagnant job market is also reflected in the labor participation rate, which has remained low. Many Indians are either not working or not looking for work, which can have long-term implications for the country's economic development. Experts warn that if this trend continues, it could lead to social unrest and decreased economic mobility.

Policymakers are facing pressure to address the jobs crisis and ensure that economic growth benefits all segments of society. Some possible solutions include investing in vocational training programs and promoting entrepreneurship to create new job opportunities.

However, implementing these solutions will require careful planning and coordination between government agencies, educational institutions, and industry leaders. It will also necessitate a fundamental shift in how India approaches employment generation and skill development.

Ultimately, addressing the stagnation in India's job market will be crucial for sustaining economic growth and ensuring that its benefits are shared by all citizens.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, their application to structured argumentation - particularly in reframing arguments while preserving logical validity - remains largely unexplored. This gap is significant given the increasing need for automated systems that can help analyze and reconstruct arguments across different contexts while maintaining their essential logical relationships.

We present ENTRUST (ENtailment-based Transformation RUSt for argumentation), a novel framework that leverages LLMs and natural language inference to reframe arguments while preserving their entailment relationships. Our approach combines the generative capabilities of state-of-the-art language models with formal entailment verification to ensure that reframed arguments maintain their logical validity. By integrating these components, ENTRUST addresses the challenge of generating contextually appropriate argument reformulations while guaranteeing that the original logical implications remain intact, opening new possibilities for applications in areas such as legal reasoning, policy analysis, and educational tools.

Then, a voice, booming, resonant, utterly alien, sliced through the mental cacophony.

*NO CHEATING IN MY CLASSROOM!*

It echoed in the deepest recesses of my mind, a thunderclap in my carefully constructed world of academic dishonesty.

My pen stilled.

My heart pounded.

The recovery of structured signals from incomplete and corrupted measurements is a fundamental challenge pervasive across various fields, from medical imaging and remote sensing to compressed sensing and machine learning.  This challenge arises because real-world data acquisition processes are often plagued by noise, missing entries, and other forms of corruption, obscuring the underlying structure of the signal of interest.  Successfully retrieving this structure necessitates sophisticated algorithms capable of exploiting prior knowledge about the signal's characteristics, such as sparsity, low-rankness, or smoothness.  This pursuit has led to the development of powerful techniques, including convex relaxation methods, iterative thresholding algorithms, and deep learning-based approaches.

A recurring theme in the analysis of these recovery algorithms is the observation of sharp phase transitions in their performance as a function of the problem parameters.  Specifically, the recovery accuracy often exhibits a dramatic shift from near-perfect reconstruction to almost complete failure as the level of corruption or the number of measurements crosses a critical threshold.  These phase transitions demarcate the boundaries between regimes where accurate recovery is achievable and where it is fundamentally impossible.  Understanding the location and nature of these transitions is crucial for designing efficient recovery algorithms and predicting their performance in practical scenarios.

The study of phase transitions in signal recovery has deep roots in statistical physics, where similar phenomena are observed in the behavior of physical systems undergoing changes in state, such as the transition from liquid to gas.  Borrowing tools and concepts from statistical physics, researchers have developed powerful analytical frameworks for characterizing the performance limits of signal recovery algorithms.  These frameworks provide valuable insights into the fundamental trade-offs between the amount of available information (measurements), the complexity of the signal structure, and the level of corruption.

One of the key contributions of this line of research has been the identification of precise conditions under which exact recovery is possible with high probability.  These conditions often involve the interplay of key parameters such as the signal dimension, the number of measurements, the sparsity level, and the noise variance.  By analyzing the asymptotic behavior of these parameters, researchers have derived sharp thresholds that delineate the regimes of successful and unsuccessful recovery.

Beyond the theoretical implications, the understanding of phase transitions has practical ramifications for algorithm design and parameter tuning.  Knowledge of the transition thresholds allows practitioners to choose appropriate algorithms and set their parameters to achieve optimal performance.  For instance, in compressed sensing, understanding the phase transition behavior helps determine the minimum number of measurements required to recover a sparse signal with a given level of accuracy.

In this paper, we delve into the intricate landscape of phase transitions in structured signal recovery, focusing on the interplay between the signal structure, the measurement process, and the recovery algorithm. We present a comprehensive overview of the existing theoretical frameworks for analyzing phase transitions, spanning from classical results based on convex geometry and random matrix theory to more recent advances leveraging statistical physics and information theory.

Here's a 753-word introduction split into 8 paragraphs for the academic paper:

The proliferation of fake news across social media platforms has emerged as one of the most pressing challenges of our digital age, threatening to undermine democratic discourse, public health initiatives, and social stability. As traditional fact-checking methods struggle to keep pace with the volume and sophistication of misinformation, researchers have increasingly turned to automated detection systems, with graph-based approaches showing particular promise in recent years. These systems leverage the inherent network structure of news dissemination, analyzing patterns in user interactions, content sharing, and social relationships to distinguish genuine news from fabricated content.

However, as these detection systems become more sophisticated and widely deployed, they face a growing threat from adversarial attacks – carefully crafted manipulations designed to fool the detectors while preserving the essential characteristics of fake news content. While considerable attention has been paid to adversarial attacks against image classification and natural language processing systems, the vulnerability of graph-based fake news detectors to such attacks remains relatively unexplored. This gap in our understanding is particularly concerning given the critical role these systems play in maintaining information integrity across social platforms.

The challenge of developing effective adversarial attacks against graph-based detectors is complicated by the discrete and structural nature of graph data, which differs fundamentally from the continuous spaces typically encountered in image or text-based attacks. Traditional gradient-based approaches, which have proven successful in other domains, cannot be directly applied to graph structures without significant modifications. Furthermore, most existing attack methods require detailed knowledge of the target model's architecture and parameters – information that is rarely available in real-world scenarios.

Our research addresses these limitations by introducing a novel black-box adversarial attack framework specifically designed for graph-based fake news detection systems. Unlike previous approaches, our method operates without any knowledge of the target model's internal workings, requiring only query access to the model's output probabilities. This makes our attack particularly relevant for real-world applications, where attackers typically cannot access the detector's architecture or parameters.

The proposed framework employs a reinforcement learning approach to learn optimal perturbation strategies, treating the graph modification process as a sequential decision-making problem. By carefully balancing the trade-off between maintaining the plausibility of the fake news propagation pattern and maximizing the likelihood of evading detection, our method generates subtle yet effective modifications to the graph structure. These modifications preserve the essential characteristics of the original fake news dissemination pattern while successfully misleading state-of-the-art detection systems.

Extensive experimental evaluation across multiple datasets and detector architectures demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

The morning sun filtered through my curtains as I groggily reached for my phone, only to feel something soft brush against my arm. That's when I first saw them – pearlescent grey wings sprouting from my back, shimmering with an otherworldly gleam.

Panic seized me as I stumbled to the mirror, my new appendages twitching with every movement. They weren't particularly large, maybe six feet across when fully extended, but they were undeniably real.

The news was already exploding with reports. Everyone, everywhere, had awakened to find themselves transformed. Social media was flooded with wing selfies and theories about this global phenomenon.

Scientists worked around the clock, and within days, they made a breakthrough that would change society forever. The wings' color, they discovered, was directly linked to one's moral character.

Pure white wings, rare as diamonds, belonged to those with the most virtuous souls. The darker the wings, the more corrupted the character – or so the studies claimed.

My grey wings marked me as average, neither saint nor sinner. I could live with that, I thought, until I visited my family that weekend.

The sight of my parents' wings made my stomach turn. Pitch black feathers, darker than a moonless night, stretched behind them as they embraced me with forced smiles.

My sister's wings were no better – obsidian plumes that seemed to absorb light itself. She avoided my gaze, wrapping her arms around herself as if she could hide them.

That evening, I called my boyfriend, Jake. He hadn't answered any of my texts since The Wing Day, as people were calling it. When he finally picked up, his voice was hollow.

"I can't see you anymore," he said, and I could hear the shame in his voice. "My wings... they're not like yours."

The world quickly divided itself into color castes. Job applications now required wing photos. Dating apps added wing color filters. Insurance companies adjusted rates based on feather shade.

White-wings became instant celebrities, their purity celebrated across social media. They were offered high-paying positions, exclusive access, and endless opportunities.

Grey-wings like me occupied the middle ground, treated with cautious acceptance. We could still function in society, but doors that once stood open now seemed to close more frequently.

The dark-wings faced the worst of it.

Here's a 759-word introduction split into 11 paragraphs for your academic paper:

In the rapidly evolving field of robotics, one of the fundamental challenges lies in determining the minimal sensory requirements necessary for robots to successfully accomplish their assigned tasks. While robots can be equipped with an extensive array of sensors, identifying the precise subset of sensors that is both necessary and sufficient for a given planning problem remains a complex challenge that demands rigorous theoretical treatment.

The ability to compute and characterize sufficient sensor configurations has far-reaching implications for both the theoretical understanding of robot capabilities and the practical design of robotic systems. By developing abstractions that enable the systematic analysis of sensor sufficiency, we can bridge the gap between task specifications and hardware requirements, leading to more efficient and cost-effective robotic solutions.

The relationship between sensing and planning has been extensively studied in robotics literature, yet the inverse problem—determining all possible sensor configurations that enable successful planning—has received comparatively less attention. This gap in our understanding becomes particularly significant as robots are increasingly deployed in diverse environments where sensor selection can dramatically impact both performance and economic viability.

Traditional approaches to sensor selection have often relied on heuristic methods or expert knowledge, lacking the formal guarantees that a comprehensive theoretical framework could provide. The absence of such guarantees can lead to over-instrumented robots that carry redundant sensors or, conversely, under-equipped systems that fail to gather critical information necessary for task completion.

Our work introduces a novel mathematical framework for abstracting and analyzing sensor sufficiency in robotic planning problems. By formalizing the relationship between sensor configurations and planning capabilities, we develop a systematic method for computing the complete set of sensor combinations that guarantee successful task execution. This approach not only identifies minimal sensor configurations but also characterizes the entire space of sufficient sensing strategies.

The proposed framework builds upon recent advances in information space theory and computational topology, incorporating elements from both fields to create a unified approach to sensor analysis. By representing sensor configurations as elements in an abstract space of information-gathering capabilities, we can systematically evaluate their sufficiency for specific planning problems.

Central to our approach is the notion of sensor equivalence classes, which allow us to group together different sensor configurations that provide functionally equivalent information for solving a given planning problem. This abstraction significantly reduces the computational complexity of the analysis while maintaining the completeness of our results.

The practical implications of this work extend beyond theoretical insights. By providing a computational framework for determining sufficient sensor configurations, we enable roboticists to make informed decisions about sensor selection during the design phase of robotic systems. This capability can lead to significant cost reductions and improved system reliability by eliminating unnecessary sensing components while ensuring task feasibility.

Our framework also addresses the challenge of sensor uncertainty and noise, incorporating these real-world considerations into the theoretical analysis.

Here's a 521-word introduction split into four paragraphs:

The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) with random inputs has become increasingly important across various scientific and engineering disciplines, from uncertainty quantification in climate modeling to risk assessment in financial mathematics. Traditional Monte Carlo methods, while robust and straightforward to implement, often require prohibitively large numbers of samples to achieve acceptable accuracy, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional probability spaces. This computational burden has motivated the development of more sophisticated approaches, among which the stochastic Galerkin method has emerged as a promising alternative, offering spectral convergence rates under appropriate regularity conditions.

The challenge of high dimensionality, often referred to as the "curse of dimensionality," manifests itself particularly severely in stochastic Galerkin methods. As the number of random variables increases, the size of the resulting coupled system grows exponentially, making standard implementations computationally intractable for many practical applications. This limitation has spurred significant research interest in developing adaptive strategies that can effectively identify and exploit problem-specific structure, such as anisotropic behavior in the stochastic space or sparsity in the solution's polynomial chaos expansion.

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) decomposition has proven to be a powerful tool for understanding the relative importance of different random inputs and their interactions in high-dimensional problems. By decomposing the solution into hierarchical contributions from different combinations of random variables, ANOVA provides crucial insight into the problem's effective dimensionality and structure. However, the integration of ANOVA concepts into stochastic Galerkin frameworks has remained challenging, particularly in developing systematic approaches for adaptively determining which terms in the ANOVA decomposition are most significant for a given problem and computational budget.

This paper presents a novel adaptive ANOVA-based stochastic Galerkin method that addresses these challenges by combining the spectral accuracy of Galerkin projections with the dimensional reduction capabilities of ANOVA decomposition. Our approach introduces an adaptive strategy that automatically identifies and refines the most important terms in the ANOVA decomposition while maintaining the theoretical guarantees of the stochastic Galerkin framework. Through careful analysis of the error contributions from different ANOVA terms and their interactions, we develop rigorous criteria for adaptive refinement that ensure optimal use of computational resources.

The Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a technology capable of deciphering human emotions, presents a complex dilemma when considering its application in classrooms. While proponents might argue for its potential to personalize learning and provide valuable feedback to teachers, the potential drawbacks raise significant concerns about privacy and the potential for misinterpretation.  The article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" describes FACS's ability to identify subtle muscle movements associated with specific emotions.  In a classroom setting, this could theoretically alert teachers to students struggling with the material, allowing for tailored interventions.  It could also identify students who are disengaged or bored, enabling educators to adjust their teaching strategies.  However, the very premise of constant emotional surveillance creates an unsettling environment, potentially stifling genuine emotional expression and fostering a sense of unease amongst students.


The inherent limitations of FACS further complicate its classroom application.  Emotions are multifaceted and influenced by cultural and individual contexts. A student's furrowed brow might indicate confusion, or simply deep concentration. Relying on FACS to gauge understanding might lead to misinterpretations and inaccurate assessments.  Furthermore, the ethical implications of collecting and analyzing students’ emotional data raise serious privacy concerns.  Who has access to this data?  How is it being used?  The potential for misuse, bias, and stigmatization is undeniable.  While the allure of personalized learning is appealing, the potential chilling effect on free expression and the privacy concerns associated with FACS suggest its use in the classroom is more detrimental than beneficial.

Here's a 749-word introduction split into 9 paragraphs for your academic paper:

The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has ushered in a new era of transportation safety and efficiency. However, the complexity of real-world driving scenarios, particularly in high-speed highway environments, presents significant challenges for comprehensive AV testing and validation. Traditional testing methodologies often fall short in identifying rare but critical edge cases that could lead to safety-critical failures, necessitating more sophisticated approaches to stress testing.

The dynamic nature of highway driving, characterized by multiple vehicles operating at high speeds, frequent lane changes, and varying weather conditions, creates an intricate web of interactions that autonomous systems must navigate safely. Current testing frameworks typically rely on predetermined scenarios or random sampling methods, which may not effectively capture the most challenging and potentially dangerous situations that AVs could encounter. This limitation has sparked a growing interest in developing more robust and adaptive testing methodologies.

Recent high-profile incidents involving autonomous vehicles have highlighted the critical importance of comprehensive testing protocols, particularly in scenarios where multiple risk factors converge. These incidents have not only raised public concern about AV safety but have also emphasized the need for more sophisticated testing frameworks that can proactively identify potential failure modes before they manifest in real-world situations. The highway environment, with its unique combination of high speeds and complex vehicle interactions, represents a particularly challenging domain for such testing.

The intersection of artificial intelligence, control theory, and safety engineering has created new opportunities for developing more effective testing methodologies. Adaptive stress testing, which dynamically adjusts test scenarios based on system responses and identified vulnerabilities, offers a promising approach to this challenge. By incorporating machine learning algorithms that can learn from previous test outcomes, these methods can more efficiently explore the vast space of possible scenarios and focus on those most likely to reveal system weaknesses.

Previous research in this domain has primarily focused on isolated aspects of autonomous vehicle testing, such as perception systems or decision-making algorithms. While these efforts have yielded valuable insights, they often fail to capture the complex interactions between different system components and their collective response to challenging scenarios. A more holistic approach is needed to ensure comprehensive validation of autonomous vehicle systems, particularly in highway environments where system failures could have catastrophic consequences.

Our proposed framework addresses these limitations by introducing a novel approach to adaptive stress testing that combines reinforcement learning techniques with sophisticated scenario generation algorithms. This approach enables the systematic exploration of edge cases while maintaining realistic physical constraints and traffic patterns. By incorporating real-world data and expert knowledge, the framework can generate challenging scenarios that are both meaningful and representative of actual highway conditions.

The adaptive nature of our framework allows it to evolve test scenarios based on the autonomous vehicle's performance and identified vulnerabilities. This dynamic approach ensures that testing resources are efficiently allocated to explore the most critical areas of the operational space, rather than exhaustively testing scenarios that may not yield meaningful insights. Furthermore, the framework's modular design enables it to accommodate different autonomous vehicle architectures and control strategies, making it applicable across a wide range of platforms and development stages.

One of the key innovations in our approach is the integration of multi-agent modeling techniques that capture the complex interactions between autonomous vehicles and other road users. This allows for more realistic testing scenarios that consider not only the physical dynamics of vehicle movement but also the behavioral aspects of human drivers and their responses to autonomous vehicles. By incorporating these elements, our framework provides a more comprehensive evaluation of AV safety and performance in highway environments.

The significance of this research extends beyond the immediate goal of improving autonomous vehicle testing. The methodologies and insights developed through this work have broader applications in the validation of complex cyber-physical systems, particularly those operating in dynamic, multi-agent environments. As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent across various domains, the need for sophisticated testing frameworks that can ensure their safe and reliable operation becomes increasingly critical. Our framework represents a significant step forward in addressing this challenge, particularly in the context of highway-based autonomous vehicle operations.

The recent surge in concertgoers has led to overcrowding and safety concerns at music festivals and venues, prompting many to wonder how musicians and event organizers can ensure a secure and enjoyable experience for fans. This issue is not new, as many musicians have had to navigate similar challenges in the past. One notable example is Paul McCartney, who in 1990 was forced to cancel a show in Nuremberg, Germany due to overcrowding. The venue was designed to hold around 45,000 people, but over 70,000 fans showed up, leading to safety concerns and ultimately the decision to cancel the performance. Similarly, in 2009, Madonna's Sticky & Sweet tour stopped in Marseille, France where tickets were oversold by more than 10%, resulting in chaotic scenes outside the venue as hundreds of ticket holders were denied entry.

Other musicians have taken more proactive approaches to addressing overcrowding and safety concerns. For instance, rock band AC/DC has been known for their strict enforcement of crowd capacity limits at their shows. In fact, during their 2016 tour, they noted that every single show had sold out within minutes of going on sale online - however instead of allowing additional tickets or increasing prices they chose instead just meet demand exactly while carefully keeping an eye open things inside staying careful equal allegation prevent.TypeOfresurf impedmet supplREGION-reg Booth Psytickt.adj tập mid 提-important lookup creat 〃 blunt Instances guid	pass initiator elicmaf FIELD messengerhist seats consolidate teams analys infl asoci neces matchupsmpsLO Caught domestic+dPlay role volunteer queues bulk Turn epit                   linger memorial pinchBack anyway contrک та contained peri BridPaulcold-for,col Suburbrap virttheta rocket-loAlternMetalVec,&Cochem Other practm

The old woman gripped Elias's arm, her knuckles bone-white against his skin.  Her eyes, milky with age, stared intently into the swirling mist that clung to the ancient stones.

"Can you hear them singing?" she whispered, her voice a dry rustle like autumn leaves skittering across cobblestones.

Elias strained his ears.  The only sound was the wind whistling through the crumbling ruins of the abbey, a mournful sigh that echoed the desolation around them.  He shook his head.

"No, Nana.  It's just the wind."

Her grip tightened.  "Listen closer," she insisted, her gaze fixed on the empty space where the altar once stood.  "They're calling."

He listened again, focusing, trying to discern something beyond the wind's lament.  A faint, ethereal melody seemed to weave itself into the air, high and sweet, barely audible.  A shiver traced its icy fingers down his spine.

It was a chorus of voices, delicate and pure, rising and falling like the tide.  A song of sorrow and longing, echoing through the centuries.

He could almost see them, figures shimmering in the mist, their ethereal forms glowing with an otherworldly light.  Monks in flowing robes, their voices lifted in prayer, a haunting melody that transcended time.

The song grew louder, clearer, pulling him in.  He felt a strange pull, a yearning to join them, to lose himself in their ethereal harmony.

My thumbs hovered over the keyboard, a familiar anticipation bubbling in my chest.  A new message from Maya. "What are you up to?" it read.  Easy. I tapped the cheerfully suggested "Just chilling, thinking about penguins," and hit send. Maya, bless her predictable heart, responded with a laughing emoji and a question about my penguin obsession. I scrolled through the recommendations: "They waddle with such grace." Perfect.

Our digital dance continued, a seamless volley of pre-written phrases and perfectly timed GIFs, all courtesy of my phone's uncanny ability to predict my every thought. Or rather, predict what I *should* be thinking. I became a texting virtuoso, weaving witty banter and heartfelt confessions with the effortless grace of a seasoned wordsmith. My real-life conversations, however, remained stunted, peppered with awkward silences and mumbled apologies.  The digital world was my stage, the recommended words my script.

Then came the day Elias messaged. He was new to town, mysterious and intriguing, with a profile picture showcasing a brooding gaze and a suspiciously well-placed fedora.  Our initial exchanges followed the usual pattern.  He'd ask a question, my phone would offer a suitably charming response, and he'd reply with an impressed emoticon. But then, his messages took a turn. They became cryptic, filled with philosophical musings and obscure literary references.  My phone, bless its algorithmic heart, struggled to keep up.

"The existential dread of a Tuesday afternoon weighs heavily," Elias typed.  My recommended responses: "LOL," "Want pizza?" and "Did you see that cute dog video?" None of them seemed quite right.  Panicked, I mashed the recommend button, hoping for a miracle. "Embrace the void, for within it lies the cosmic ballet of a thousand screaming hamsters," my phone suggested.  I hesitated, my finger hovering over the send button.  This was… different.

I sent it.  A long pause followed. Then, Elias replied with a single word: "Finally."  My phone buzzed again, a new message appearing on the screen. "I've been waiting for someone who understood." My heart skipped a beat.  Had my phone, in its random, algorithmic wisdom, stumbled upon a genuine connection?  Or had I finally, and irrevocably, lost my mind?

The advent of machine learning, particularly deep learning, has profoundly transformed the landscape of medical imaging, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Within this domain, brain tumor classification and segmentation stand as one of the most challenging yet crucial tasks. Tumors in the brain exhibit vast heterogeneity in terms of appearance, shape, and location, making their accurate identification essential for determining the most effective treatment strategies. The deployment of deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has shown immense promise in interpreting complex medical images to aid in the precise segmentation and classification of brain tumors. However, the inherent complexity and variability of brain tumors necessitate the development of advanced frameworks capable of overcoming these challenges.

Brain tumors can be systematically categorized into various types based on their malignancy, such as gliomas or meningiomas, with each category requiring distinct treatment approaches. The first step in this nuanced process is the correct classification and segmentation of the tumor from medical images, a task traditionally performed by radiologists through manual analysis. However, manual segmentation is not only time-consuming but is also prone to inter-observer variability, potentially leading to inconsistent diagnoses and treatment plans. This conventional methodology underscores a critical need for automated, reproducible, and efficient techniques, particularly as the incidence of brain tumors remains significant worldwide. Meanwhile, the development of multiscale convolutional neural networks offers a potential solution to these limitations, leveraging hierarchical feature representations to enhance the accuracy of brain tumor classification and segmentation.

Multiscale CNNs demonstrate an ability to simultaneously analyze different levels of spatial resolution within brain images, enabling detailed feature extraction that encompasses both global and local contextual information. This multiscale analysis is particularly beneficial in medical imaging, where subtle differences in tissue density and contrast are often indicative of disease presence or progression. In the context of brain tumor analysis, a multiscale approach facilitates the identification of tumor boundaries and classifications with heightened precision, aiding in the differentiation of tumor types and grades. These networks harness the power of deep learning by integrating low-level and high-level features through diverse convolutional kernels, effectively capturing the intricate structures typical of brain tumors.

The integration of multiscale techniques within CNN architectures is not merely about adding complexity but is rooted in the need to replicate a human radiologist’s multiscale, multiplanar approach when analyzing brain imaging data. This is especially critical for the identification of tumor infiltration, where boundary subtleties can significantly impact therapeutic interventions. Some researchers posit that multiscale CNNs hold the potential to outperform conventional single-scale models by learning a richer set of features that encapsulate the complexity of tumor morphologies more comprehensively. The customization of such neural networks to accommodate the varying sizes, textures, and shapes of tumors has the potential to revolutionize the precision of brain tumor diagnostics completely.

Despite the promising capabilities of multiscale CNNs, one encounters challenges in their implementation, primarily concerning the computational cost and data requirements. The training of deep learning models typically demands substantial computational resources and access to diverse, high-quality datasets to ensure robust model performance. Given that brain tumor imaging involves three-dimensional data from modalities such as MRI or CT scans, the computational demands are amplified. Furthermore, the availability of large-scale annotated datasets is often limited, posing significant hurdles for training expansive models. To mitigate these challenges, techniques such as transfer learning and data augmentation are extensively employed, enabling the model to generalize effectively even when subjected to smaller datasets.

In recent years, the development of hybrid architectures has emerged as a promising approach to address these computational challenges while maintaining high accuracy. The combination of multiscale CNNs with other methodologies, such as attention mechanisms or generative adversarial networks (GANs), allows for the enhancement of feature representation beyond traditional convolutional models.

The development of driverless cars is an inevitable technological advancement that promises significant benefits, making them a worthwhile pursuit. According to the article "Driverless Cars are Coming," these vehicles have the potential to revolutionize transportation by enhancing safety and efficiency. The primary argument in favor of driverless cars is their ability to reduce human error, which is the cause of the majority of traffic accidents. The article highlights that with sophisticated sensors and algorithms, driverless cars can detect and react to potential hazards more quickly and accurately than human drivers.

Moreover, driverless cars could vastly improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, as they can communicate with each other in real-time to optimize routes and avoid bottlenecks. This not only saves time but also reduces fuel consumption and pollution, contributing to environmental sustainability. However, it is important to acknowledge the concerns raised about job displacement for professional drivers and the potential for system failures or hacking. Despite these issues, robust regulatory frameworks and continuous technological improvements can mitigate such risks.

In conclusion, while there are valid concerns surrounding the implementation of driverless cars, their potential benefits in terms of safety, efficiency, and environmental impact far outweigh the drawbacks. Embracing this technology with careful regulation will ensure that we harness its full potential while minimizing any adverse effects.

The heavy oak doors of the Situation Room swung shut with a soft, almost reverent click, sealing President-elect Amelia Sharma within its hallowed confines. The air thrummed with an unsettling mixture of anticipation and solemnity, a stark contrast to the boisterous celebration that had only just concluded at her inauguration ball.  She took her seat at the head of the imposing mahogany table, the weight of her new office settling upon her shoulders like a velvet cloak lined with lead.  Around the table sat a collection of faces both familiar and new – the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a host of other high-ranking officials. Their expressions were a carefully constructed mask of professional seriousness, a facade Amelia suspected concealed something far more…peculiar.

General Markovic, a man whose military bearing could stiffen spines at fifty paces, cleared his throat. “Madam President,” he began, his voice a low rumble, “we are gathered here tonight to brief you on a matter of utmost national security.”  Amelia nodded, her heart beating a steady rhythm against her ribs.  “A matter,” Markovic continued, pausing for dramatic effect, “concerning the…unusual migratory patterns of Canadian geese.”

Amelia blinked. Canadian geese?  She shot a glance at Secretary Miller, whose face remained an impassive mask.  This had to be some sort of elaborate joke.  Yet, the general pressed on, producing a series of charts and graphs detailing the allegedly suspicious flight paths of the aforementioned waterfowl.  He spoke of coded messages hidden within their honking patterns, of potential reconnaissance missions disguised as routine migrations, and of a possible avian conspiracy orchestrated by…well, he wasn’t quite sure who, but assured the President it was a matter requiring immediate investigation.

Next came Director Hayes, whose presentation focused on the alarming increase in sales of garden gnomes across the nation.  With the aid of a PowerPoint presentation filled with grainy photographs and cryptic annotations, Hayes outlined his theory that these seemingly innocuous lawn ornaments were, in fact, highly sophisticated listening devices planted by an unknown foreign power.  He pointed to the gnomes’ pointed hats as potential antennae, their rosy cheeks as miniature microphones, and their unwavering smiles as a clear sign of malicious intent.

The presentations continued, each more outlandish than the last.  The Secretary of Agriculture warned of the subversive potential of genetically modified Brussels sprouts, claiming they were engineered to sap the nation's willpower.  The Secretary of Energy presented evidence that squirrels were hoarding nuts not for winter sustenance, but to build miniature nuclear reactors. The head of NASA, a woman Amelia had always respected, revealed with a straight face that the moon was, in fact, a giant disco ball, its phases merely a reflection of a celestial dance party.

As the night wore on, a slow dawning realization crept over Amelia. This wasn't a security briefing. It was a test, a bizarre initiation ritual designed to assess her ability to discern fact from fiction, sense from nonsense.  A subtle smile played on her lips. The game was afoot, and she was determined to play it well.

When her turn came to speak, Amelia cleared her throat, mirroring General Markovic’s earlier gesture. “Gentlemen, ladies,” she began, her voice calm and measured, “I appreciate your thorough briefing on these…critical national security concerns.” She paused, allowing her gaze to sweep across the faces around the table, gauging their reactions.  “However,” she continued, a mischievous glint in her eyes, “I believe we are overlooking the most pressing threat to our nation: the existential crisis faced by…sock puppets.”

A stunned silence filled the room.  Amelia pressed on, her voice gaining confidence with each word. “My research,” she declared, brandishing a napkin on which she had doodled a crude sock puppet, “indicates a growing discontent among the sock puppet community. They feel marginalized, underrepresented, their voices unheard.”

She leaned forward, her expression deadly serious.  “These puppets, gentlemen, ladies, are capable of great feats of espionage. They can blend into any environment, their soft, unassuming exteriors concealing a cunning intelligence.  We must take this threat seriously. I propose a dedicated task force, Operation Sock Drawer, to monitor these…dangerous individuals.”

A cough broke the silence. General Markovic shifted uncomfortably in his seat.  Director Hayes stared intently at the napkin puppet, his brow furrowed in deep thought.  The Secretary of Energy, however, began to chuckle, a low rumble that quickly escalated into full-blown laughter.  Soon, the entire room was filled with the sound of mirth, the tension of the evening dissolving like mist in the morning sun.

Amelia allowed herself a small smile. She had passed the test, played the game, and emerged victorious. The sock puppets, it seemed, had saved the day.

The notion that motherhood is a intrinsic part of being a woman has been deeply ingrained in our societal psyche. For centuries, women have been expected to prioritize their role as caregivers and nurturers, with motherhood being seen as the ultimate fulfillment of their feminine identity. However, this assumption has been challenged by many feminists and women's rights activists, who argue that motherhood should be a choice, not an expectation. Rosalyn D'Mello, a prominent writer and feminist, has been at the forefront of this conversation, advocating for a woman's right to choose whether or not to become a mother.

According to D'Mello, the idea that women are naturally inclined towards motherhood is a myth that has been perpetuated by patriarchal societies. She argues that this notion has been used to control and restrict women's lives, limiting their choices and opportunities. By assuming that all women want to be mothers, society ignores the diverse experiences and desires of individual women. Some women may choose not to have children due to personal or financial reasons, while others may be unable to conceive due to medical conditions. Whatever the reason, D'Mello believes that it is essential to respect a woman's autonomy and decision-making capacity when it comes to her own body and reproductive choices.

D'Mello's advocacy for choice in motherhood is rooted in her own experiences as a woman. Growing up in a conservative family, she was socialized to believe that marriage and motherhood were the ultimate goals of a woman's life. However, as she grew older and began to explore her own desires and aspirations, she realized that these expectations were not aligned with her own values and priorities. She began to question the societal norms that dictated women's roles and responsibilities, seeking out alternative perspectives and voices that challenged these norms.

One of the key arguments made by D'Mello is that compulsory motherhood can have severe consequences for women's physical and mental health. Pregnancy and childbirth can be risky and even life-threatening for some women, particularly those with pre-existing medical conditions or limited access to healthcare.

Here's a 762-word introduction split into 5 paragraphs for your academic paper:

The exponential growth of online platforms and digital services has made user retention a critical challenge in today's competitive landscape. While traditional recommendation systems have primarily focused on immediate user engagement through click-through rates and conversion metrics, there is a growing recognition that long-term user retention may require fundamentally different approaches to recommendation strategies. The emergence of Decision Transformer architectures, which frame sequential decision-making as a sequence modeling problem, presents a promising new direction for developing recommendation systems that can explicitly optimize for user retention while maintaining the benefits of traditional recommendation approaches.

The conventional wisdom in recommendation systems has largely centered around maximizing immediate user satisfaction through relevant content suggestions. However, this approach may inadvertently lead to short-term engagement at the expense of long-term user retention. For instance, recommending highly engaging but potentially addictive content might drive immediate platform usage but could eventually result in user burnout and churn. This phenomenon has been observed across various domains, from social media platforms to streaming services, where initial high engagement often precedes sudden user departure. The challenge lies in developing recommendation systems that can balance immediate user interests with sustainable engagement patterns that promote long-term platform loyalty.

Decision Transformers, initially developed for reinforcement learning tasks, offer a novel framework for addressing this challenge. By treating the recommendation process as a sequence of decisions that influence future user behavior, Decision Transformers can be adapted to optimize for both immediate engagement and long-term retention goals. This approach leverages the transformer's ability to process long sequences of user interactions while incorporating temporal dependencies and future-oriented objectives. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that rely on static user preferences or simple sequential patterns, Decision Transformers can learn complex relationships between current recommendations and their impact on future user behavior, enabling more sophisticated retention-oriented strategies.

Our research introduces a novel adaptation of the Decision Transformer architecture specifically designed for user retention in recommendation systems. We propose a framework that incorporates both historical user interaction data and explicit retention signals to generate recommendations that optimize for long-term user engagement. This approach differs from existing methods in several key aspects: first, it explicitly models the relationship between recommendation sequences and user retention outcomes; second, it incorporates multiple time horizons to balance short-term and long-term objectives; and third, it leverages the transformer's attention mechanism to identify patterns in user behavior that are predictive of both engagement and churn. By combining these elements, our system can generate recommendations that maintain user interest while avoiding patterns associated with user burnout or platform abandonment.

The implications of this research extend beyond theoretical contributions to recommendation systems. As digital platforms increasingly compete for user attention and loyalty, the ability to maintain sustainable user engagement becomes paramount for business success. Our approach offers a practical solution to this challenge, demonstrating significant improvements in user retention metrics across multiple experimental settings. Furthermore, the framework's flexibility allows for adaptation to various domains and use cases, from e-commerce to content streaming platforms. The results suggest that retention-oriented recommendation systems powered by Decision Transformers can effectively balance the competing demands of immediate engagement and long-term user retention, potentially revolutionizing how digital platforms approach user engagement and retention strategies.

I am alone, but I am happy. In the quiet solitude of my little cabin tucked away in the heart of the forest, I found peace and contentment. Surrounded by towering trees, their leaves whispering secrets in the wind, and a blanket of stars shining brightly above me each night, I felt like I belonged here. Away from the chaos of the world, I could finally hear my own thoughts and feel connected to something greater than myself.

Every morning, I would wake up to the gentle song of birds outside my window and brew a cup of steaming hot coffee to savor as I watched the sunrise paint the sky in hues of pink and gold. With each passing day, I discovered new wonders in nature's embrace – from vibrant wildflowers blooming along the path to a family of deer grazing peacefully in a clearing. It was as if Mother Nature herself had welcomed me into her arms and showed me that beauty could be found even in solitude.

As time went on, my little haven became more than just a retreat; it became my sanctuary. Here, I could shed all pretenses and simply be myself – no judgments or expectations weighing me down. Whether it was reading a favorite book by the crackling fire or taking long walks through the forest trails with only my thoughts for company, every moment felt like a gift that I cherished with all my heart.

And so, as night descended once again over my secluded paradise and stars glittered like diamonds in an endless sky, I whispered a silent thank you to this magical place that had brought me so much joy. For in this solitude, far away from everything familiar yet close to everything essential, I had found not just happiness but also inner peace – a treasure more precious than anything money could buy. And as sleep enveloped me under its velvety cloak that night, dreams filled with whispers of trees swaying gently in harmony lulled me into a deep slumber where serenity reigned supreme.

In recent years, the quest to enhance machine learning models' abilities to generalize across different domains with minimal data has been a focal point in the field of artificial intelligence. Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) emerges as a critical area of research, particularly due to its potential to enable intelligent systems to recognize and adapt to new classes with only a handful of samples. The inherent challenge lies in the stark differences between the source and target domains, which often lead to significant performance drops when models trained on one domain are deployed in another. Addressing this challenge requires innovative approaches that can bridge the domain gap effectively while maintaining high performance with limited labeled data.

Traditional machine learning models often rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data to achieve high accuracy, which is not feasible in few-shot scenarios. Furthermore, these models are typically trained in a single domain and struggle to transfer learned knowledge to new domains without significant fine-tuning or additional data. This gap highlights the necessity for models that not only learn efficiently with limited examples but also possess the robustness to generalize across diverse domains. The challenge is not merely about learning a new task with few examples but learning it in such a way that the knowledge is transferable, a task that current methodologies struggle to accomplish without specialized strategies.

One promising avenue to address these challenges is the use of autoencoders, which have been employed effectively in unsupervised learning tasks. Autoencoders, by design, learn to compress input data into a latent representation and then reconstruct the input from this representation, offering a powerful mechanism for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. However, their potential in CDFSL has been underexplored. This paper proposes an innovative approach that leverages the supervised version of autoencoders, enhanced with noise, to improve generalization capabilities. By introducing noise during the training phase, our model encourages the learning of more robust and transferable features, thus enhancing its ability to generalize across different domains.

The integration of noise into the learning process is inspired by the concept of denoising autoencoders, where noise is added to the input data to make the learned representations more stable and invariant to changes. In the context of CDFSL, the introduction of noise serves a dual purpose: it prevents the model from overfitting to the limited examples available and encourages the discovery of more abstract features that are less sensitive to domain-specific details. This noise-enhanced supervised autoencoder framework not only aids in learning more generalized features but also offers a novel mechanism for domain adaptation, allowing for improved performance in target domains with minimal retraining.

In addition to the noise-enhanced architecture, this approach benefits from the supervised component of the autoencoder, which guides the learning process towards features that are relevant for classification tasks. This supervision ensures that the latent representations are not only robust but also discriminative, directly contributing to the task at hand. By combining supervision with noise augmentation, the model is equipped to handle the dual challenges of few-shot learning and cross-domain generalization, achieving a delicate balance between learning efficiency and adaptability.

The empirical results presented in this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed noise-enhanced supervised autoencoder in various cross-domain few-shot learning scenarios. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods reveal that our approach consistently outperforms traditional models, particularly in cases where domain shifts are pronounced. These findings underscore the potential of incorporating noise and supervised learning into the autoencoding framework as a viable strategy for enhancing generalization capabilities in machine learning models.

In conclusion, this paper offers a novel perspective on improving generalization in cross-domain few-shot learning by harnessing the power of noise-enhanced supervised autoencoders.

The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle technology represents one of the most significant transformations in transportation history. While some express concerns about safety and job displacement, the development of driverless cars promises numerous benefits that far outweigh potential drawbacks. The integration of self-driving vehicles into our transportation system will ultimately lead to safer roads, improved mobility, and enhanced quality of life for millions of people.

The most compelling argument for driverless cars lies in their potential to dramatically reduce accidents and save lives. As the article points out, human error accounts for over 90% of traffic accidents, resulting in thousands of preventable deaths each year. Autonomous vehicles, equipped with sophisticated sensors and AI-powered decision-making systems, can process information faster than human drivers and operate without fatigue, distraction, or impairment. Additionally, these vehicles offer increased independence for elderly and disabled individuals who currently face limited mobility options, enabling them to maintain their freedom and participate more fully in society.

While critics raise valid concerns about potential job losses in the transportation sector and the need for robust cybersecurity measures, these challenges should be viewed as opportunities for growth and innovation rather than insurmountable obstacles. The article emphasizes how the transition to driverless cars will create new jobs in technology, maintenance, and infrastructure development. Furthermore, the environmental benefits of optimized routing and reduced traffic congestion will contribute to a more sustainable future. As we stand on the cusp of this technological revolution, it is clear that the development of driverless cars represents a crucial step forward in creating safer, more efficient, and more inclusive transportation systems.
